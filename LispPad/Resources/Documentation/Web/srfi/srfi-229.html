    <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

    <p>This SRFI defines <dfn>tagged procedures</dfn>, which are procedures
      that are tagged with a Scheme value when created through the
      syntax <code>lambda/tag</code> and <code>case-lambda/tag</code>.  The
      value of the tag of a procedure can be retrieved
      with <code>procedure-tag</code>, and the
      predicate <code>procedure/tag?</code> discerns whether a procedure is
      tagged.</p>

    <h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

    <p>The only way to interact with an ordinary Scheme procedure, besides
      applying predicates like <code>eqv?</code> or <code>procedure?</code> to
      it, is to call it.  Some applications, however, have the need to
      associate data with a procedure that can be retrieved without calling the
      procedure.  For an R7RS system, this can be achieved in principle by
      associating the data through a weak hash table.  For an R6RS system, this
      is not possible because R6RS does not expose a coarse-enough equivalence
      predicate for procedures.  But even for an R7RS system, such an approach
      is not straightforward.  Firstly, weak hash tables are not necessarily
      available and, secondly, even for an R7RS system, procedure equivalence
      is not trivial because the expression types that create
      procedures, <code>lambda</code> and <code>case-lambda</code>, are not
      necessarily generative.</p>

    <p>Therefore, this SRFI defines a simple interface that can be used to
      create tagged procedures, to detect the existence of a tag, and to
      retrieve it.  Through this mechanism, even R6RS procedures can be given
      an identity that can be tested in Scheme code.</p>

    <p>The mechanism defined in this SRFI can be used to implement procedure
      properties, documentation strings, source location information, and other
      things in Scheme.</p>

    <p>Scheme records as defined by R<sup>6</sup>RS or R<sup>7</sup>R7
      cannot be called as procedures, but this SRFI can be used to
      implement an alternative record system where the record
      instances are procedures whose actual fields are stored in a
      private record as the procedure's tag.</p>

    <p>In order to not prevent certain optimizations, the procedure
      tags defined through the facilities presented here are
      immutable.  In other words, the Scheme object used as a tag is
      fixed at procedure creation time.  If an application needs
      mutable fields attached to a procedure, a Scheme object that is
      itself mutable (like a pair, a string, a vector, or a record with
      mutable fields) has to be used as a tag.</p>

    <p>Contrary to proposals that conceptually attach properties to
      every procedure, this SRFI gives implementations the freedom to
      have disjoint types of tagged and untagged procedures, both
      non-empty.  In particular, this SRFI can be implemented at zero
      cost for the general case of untagged procedures.</p>

    <p>In fact, in the context of SRFI 229, one shouldn't think of
      procedures falling in just two classes, untagged and tagged ones (note
      that all procedures may be implementable as tagged ones), but falling
      into infinitely many classes, one for each type of its tag.  So one can
      really think of them as callable structs, where the struct is in the
      tag.  (See MIT/GNU Scheme's apply hooks for an example.)</p>

    <p>Future SRFIs are expected to build on SRFI 229 to provide a
      procedure type with an extensible tag field, allowing
      independent composition.</p>

    <h3>Application Hooks</h3>

    <p>MIT/GNU Scheme Scheme
      defines <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/documentation/stable/mit-scheme-ref/Application-Hooks.html"><dfn>application
      hooks</dfn> and <dfn>entities</dfn></a>, which are objects that can
      applied like procedures.  As a demonstration of the generality of the
      primitives defined by this SRFI, we give a portable sample implementation of
      application hooks and entities on top of this SRFI:</p>

    <pre>(define-library (application-hook)
  (export make-apply-hook
          apply-hook?
          apply-hook-procedure
          set-apply-hook-procedure!
          apply-hook-extra
          set-apply-hook-extra!
          make-entity
          entity?
          entity-procedure
          set-entity-procedure!
          entity-extra
          set-entity-extra!)
  (import (scheme base)
          (srfi 229))
  (begin
    (define-record-type apply-hook-tag
      (make-apply-hook-tag procedure extra)
      apply-hook-tag?
      (procedure apply-hook-tag-procedure apply-hook-tag-set-procedure!)
      (extra apply-hook-tag-extra apply-hook-tag-set-extra!))

    (define (make-apply-hook proc obj)
      (let ((tag (make-apply-hook-tag proc obj)))
        (lambda/tag tag arg*
          (apply (apply-hook-tag-procedure tag) arg*))))

    (define (apply-hook? obj)
      (and (procedure/tag? obj)
           (apply-hook-tag? (procedure-tag obj))))

    (define (apply-hook-procedure hook)
      (apply-hook-tag-procedure (procedure-tag hook)))

    (define (set-apply-hook-procedure! hook proc)
      (apply-hook-tag-set-procedure! (procedure-tag hook) proc))

    (define (apply-hook-extra hook)
      (apply-hook-tag-extra (procedure-tag hook)))

    (define (set-apply-hook-extra! hook obj)
      (apply-hook-tag-set-extra! (procedure-tag hook) obj))

    (define-record-type entity-tag
      (make-entity-tag procedure extra)
      entity-tag?
      (procedure entity-tag-procedure entity-tag-set-procedure!)
      (extra entity-tag-extra entity-tag-set-extra!))

    (define (make-entity proc obj)
      (let ((tag (make-entity-tag proc obj)))
        (define f
          (lambda/tag tag arg*
            (apply (entity-tag-procedure tag) f arg*)))
        f))

    (define (entity? obj)
      (and (procedure/tag? obj)
           (entity-tag? (procedure-tag obj))))

    (define (entity-procedure hook)
      (entity-tag-procedure (procedure-tag hook)))

    (define (set-entity-procedure! hook proc)
      (entity-tag-set-procedure! (procedure-tag hook) proc))

    (define (entity-extra hook)
      (entity-tag-extra (procedure-tag hook)))

    (define (set-entity-extra! hook obj)
      (entity-tag-set-extra! (procedure-tag hook) obj))))</pre>

    <h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>

    <h3>Equivalence</h3>

    <p>When invoked on two objects, the <code>eqv?</code> procedure
      returns <code>#f</code> if one object is a tagged procedure and
      the other object is a non-procedure or a procedure that is not
      tagged, or if both objects are tagged procedures but tagged with
      values such that <code>eq?</code> would return <code>#f</code>
      when invoked on them.</p>

    <p><i>Note:</i> Note that in an R<sup>7</sup>RS system, all
      procedures are conceptually tagged with a storage location and
      that <code>eqv?</code> returns <code>#t</code> when invoked on
      procedures whose location tags are equal.  As each tagged
      procedure (in the sense of this SRFI) is also a procedure in the
      sense of the Scheme reports, tagged procedures inherit this
      behavior in R<sup>7</sup>RS systems.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, the syntax and procedures of this SRFI can
      be used to give procedures also in R<sup>6</sup>RS systems an
      identity that can be discerned through Scheme procedures:</p>

    <pre class="example">(define-syntax lambda/id
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((lambda/id formals body)
     (lambda/tag (list 'tag) formals body))))

(define lambda/id=?
  (lambda (f g)
    (assert (procedure/tag? f))
    (assert (procedure/tag? g))
    (eq? (procedure-tag f) (procedure-tag g))))

(define p (lambda/id (x) x))
(lambda/id=? p p)<span class="result">#t</span></pre>

    <h3>Syntax</h3>

    <dl class="entries">
      <dt class="entry"><code>(case-lambda/tag <span class="token">expression</span>
	  (<span class="token">formals</span> <span class="token">body</span>) &hellip;)</code><span class="type">syntax</span>
      </dt>
      <dd>
	<p><i>Semantics:</i> First, <code>expression</code> is evaluated to
	  obtain a value.  Then a procedure is returned that accepts a variable number of
	  arguments, that is lexically scoped in the same manner as a procedure
	  resulting from a <code>lambda</code> expression, and that
	  is <dfn>tagged</dfn> with the obtained value.  When the
	  procedure is called, it behaves as if constructed by
	  a <code>case-lambda</code> expression with the
	  same <code><span class="token">formals</span></code>
	  and <code><span class="token">bodies</span></code>.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt class="entry"><code>(lambda/tag <span class="token">expression</span>
	  <span class="token">formals</span> <span class="token">body</span>)</code><span class="type">syntax</span>
      </dt>
      <dd>
	<p><i>Semantics:</i>
	  Operationally equivalent to <code>(case-lambda/tag <span class="token">expression</span>
	  (<span class="token">formals</span> <span class="token">body</span>))</code>.</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Procedures</h3>

    <dl class="entries">
      <dt class="entry"><code>(procedure/tag? <var>obj</var>)</code><span class="type">procedure</span></dt>
      <dd>
	<p>Returns <code>#t</code> if <code><var>obj</var></code> is a tagged
	  procedure and <code>#f</code> otherwise.</p>
	<p><i>Note:</i> It is unspecified whether a procedure created by
	  a <code>lambda</code> or <code>case-lambda</code> expression or
	  returned by a procedure of one of the standard libraries or defined
	  by syntax of one of the standard libraries is tagged.  In
	  case it is tagged, the tag value is unspecified.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt class="entry"><code>(procedure-tag <var>proc</var>)</code><span class="type">procedure</span></dt>
      <dd>
	<p>It is an error if <code><var>proc</var></code> is not a tagged procedure.</p>
	<p>Returns the tag of <code><var>proc</var></code>.</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <pre class="example">(define f
  (lambda/tag 42
      (x)
    (* x x)))

(procedure/tag? f)<span class="result">#t</span>

    <h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

    <p>The following is a portable R7RS implementation.  It is fully
    conformant, but tagged procedures will never be
    garbage-collected.</p>

    <pre>(define-library (srfi 229)
  (export case-lambda/tag
	  lambda/tag
	  procedure/tag?
	  procedure-tag)
  (import (scheme base)
	  (scheme case-lambda))
  (begin
    (define *tagged-procedures* '())

    (define key (list 'key))

    (define make-procedure/tag
      (lambda (tag proc)
	(define f
	  (case-lambda
	    ((arg)
	     (if (eq? arg key) tag (proc arg)))
	    (arg*
	     (apply proc arg*))))
	(set! *tagged-procedures* (cons f *tagged-procedures*))
	f))

    (define-syntax case-lambda/tag
      (syntax-rules ()
	((case-lambda/tag expr (formals body1 ... body2) ...)
	 (make-procedure/tag
	  expr
	  (case-lambda (formals body1 ... body2) ...)))))

    (define-syntax lambda/tag
      (syntax-rules ()
	((lambda/tag expr formals body1 ... body2)
	 (make-procedure/tag
	  expr
	  (lambda formals body1 ... body2)))))

    (define procedure/tag?
      (lambda (f)
	(and (memv f *tagged-procedures*) #t)))

    (define procedure-tag
      (lambda (f)
	(f key)))))</pre>

    <p>Scheme implementers should replace the above implementation by a more
      efficient one where the tag value is stored like a closure variable.</p>

    <p>A portable R6RS implementation is not possible because procedures in
      R6RS have no identity (exposed via Scheme predicates).</p>
