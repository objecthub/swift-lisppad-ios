<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>
  Unifiable boxes are, like the boxes
  of <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-111/srfi-111.html">SRFI
    111</a>, objects with a single mutable state.  A constructor,
  predicate, accessor, and mutator are provided.
</p>

<p>
In addition to this, an equality predicate and union operations (link,
union, unify) are provided.  Applying a union operation to two
unifiable boxes makes the two boxes equal (in the sense of the
equality predicate).  As a consequence, their state will also become
identical.  In the case of link and union, it will be the state of one
of the two unioned boxes.  In the case of unify, the state is
determined by a supplied unification procedure.
</p>

<p>
  Unifiable boxes are
  also known under the names <i>disjoint-set data
    structure</i>, <i>union–find data structure</i> or <i>merge–find
    set</i>.
</p>

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<p>
  The disjoint-set (or union-find) forest is a basic, well-known data
  structure that tracks partitions of a set.  For example, it can be
  used to keep track of the connected components of an undirected
  graph.  It can also be used in implementations of unification or in
  implementing Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of
  a graph.
</p>

<p>
  The abstract data type defines the three
  operations <em>make-set</em>, <em>find</em>,
  and <em>union</em>.  <em>Make-set</em> creates a singleton
  set, <em>union</em> merges two sets, and <em>find</em> returns a
  canonical representative of a set.
</p>

<p>
  There are implementations of the union-find data structure in
  Haskell, SML/NJ, C++ (Boost), etc.  It is the aim of this SRFI to
  provide an implementation for Scheme together with a
  standardized interface.
</p>

<p>This SRFI defines the interface to a union-find data type with a
  SRFI 111 boxes-like interface.  An implementation of this interface
  consists of operations for creating new unifiable boxes, getting the
  contents of a unifiable box, checking for equality of unifiable
  boxes, and for joining two unifiable boxes.
</p>

<p>Unifiable boxes are analogous to boxes as expressed in the
  following table:
</p>

<table style="text-align: left">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Operation</th><th>Boxes</th><th>Unifiable boxes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Constructor</td><td><code>box</code></td><td><code>ubox</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Predicate</td><td><code>box?</code></td><td><code>ubox?</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Accessor</td><td><code>unbox</code></td><td><code>ubox-ref</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Mutator</td><td><code>set-box!</code></td><td><code>ubox-set!</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Equality</td><td><code>eq?</code></td><td><code>ubox=?</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Union</td><td><i>n.a.</i></td><td><code>ubox-unify!</code>, <code>ubox-union!</code>, <code>ubox-link!</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><i> Note: Unifiable boxes use the standard naming pattern for
    Scheme procedures.  As SRFI 111 deviates (for historical reasons)
    from this naming pattern, the naming patterns for boxes and for
    unifiable boxes differ.
</i></p>

<p>Using the procedures of this SRFI, the classical
  operations <em>make-set</em>, <em>union</em>, and <em>find</em> can
  be defined as follows:</p>

<pre>
  (define (make-set x) (ubox x))
  (define (union x y) (ubox-link! y x))
  (define (find x) (ubox-ref x))
</pre>

<p>
  There is no comparator in the sense of <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-128/srfi-128.html">SRFI 128</a> defined
  for unifiable boxes as the equality predicate for unifiable boxes is
  not stable.
</p>

<h1>Specification</h1>

<p>
<em>Unifiable boxes</em> form a new type as if created
by <code>define-record-type</code>.  The effect of using record-type
inspection or inheritance for the unifiable box type is unspecified.
</p>

<p>
<em>Equality</em> of unifiable boxes is an equivalence relation not
finer than <code>eqv?</code>.  The union
operations <code>ubox-unify!</code>, <code>ubox-union!</code>,
and <code>ubox-link!</code> coarsen this equivalence relation.
</p>

<p>
Each unifiable box has a single mutable state, its <em>value</em>.
Equal unifiable boxes have the same state.
</p>

<p>
Each procedure below shall execute in (practically) constant time.
(The theoretical bound is <i>O(&alpha;(n))</i>, where <i>&alpha;</i>
is the inverse Ackermann function and <i>n</i> is the number of
unifiable boxes that are pairwise not <code>eq?</code> to each other.)
</p>

<p>It is an error if two threads access the same equivalence class of
  unifiable boxes at the same time.  It is no error if two threads
  access distinct equivalence classes of unifiable boxes that remain
  distinct during the accesses at the same time.
</p>

<h2>Procedures</h2>

<p><code>(ubox <em>value</em>)</code></p>

<p>
  Constructor.  Returns a newly allocated unifiable box initialized
  to <code><em>value</em></code>.  The new unifiable box is not equal
  to any previously constructed unifiable box.
</p>

<p><code>(ubox? <em>object</em>)</code></p>

<p>
  Predicate.  Returns <code>#t</code> if <em>object</em> is a unifiable
  box, and <code>#f</code> otherwise.
</p>

<p><code>(ubox-ref <em>ubox</em>)</code></p>

<p>
  Accessor.  Returns the current value of the unifiable
  box <code><em>ubox</em></code>.
</p>

<p><code>(ubox-set! <em>ubox</em> <em>value</em>)</code></p>

<p>
  Mutator.  Changes the unifiable box <code><em>ubox</em></code> to hold
  <code><em>value</em></code>.  The return value is unspecified.
</p>

<p><code>(ubox=? <em>ubox<sub>1</sub></em> <em>ubox<sub>2</sub></em>)</code></p>

<p>
  Equality predicate.  Returns <code>#t</code>
  if <code><em>ubox<sub>1</sub></em>
    and <em>ubox<sub>2</sub></em></code> are equal unifiable boxes,
  and <code>#f</code> otherwise.
</p>

<p><code>(ubox-unify! <em>proc</em> <em>ubox<sub>1</sub></em> <em>ubox<sub>2</sub></em>)</code></p>

<p>
  Union operation.  Invokes <code><em>proc</em></code> on the values
  of <code><em>ubox<sub>1</sub></em></code>
  and <code><em>ubox<sub>2</sub></em></code>,
  makes <code><em>ubox<sub>1</sub></em></code>
  and <code><em>ubox<sub>2</sub></em></code> equal, and updates their
  value to the result of the invocation of <code><em>proc</em></code>.
  The return value is unspecified.
</p>

<p><code>(ubox-union! <em>ubox<sub>1</sub></em> <em>ubox<sub>2</sub></em>)</code></p>

<p>
  Union operation.  Makes the unifiable
  boxes <code><em>ubox<sub>1</sub></em></code>
  and <code><em>ubox<sub>2</sub></em></code> equal.  The value of the
  unified box is the value of
  either <code><em>ubox<sub>1</sub></em></code>
  or <code><em>ubox<sub>2</sub></em></code> before the unification.
  The return value is unspecified.
</p>

<p><code>(ubox-link! <em>ubox<sub>1</sub></em> <em>ubox<sub>2</sub></em>)</code></p>

<p>
  Union operation.  Makes the unifiable
  boxes <code><em>ubox<sub>1</sub></em></code>
  and <code><em>ubox<sub>2</sub></em></code> equal.  The value of the
  unified box is the value of <code><em>ubox<sub>2</sub></em></code>
  before the unification.  The return value is unspecified.
</p>

<h1>Implementation</h1>

<p>The sample implementation comes in the form of the portable R7RS
  library <code>(srfi 161)</code>.  It uses path compression and
  union by rank.

<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>

<p>Disjoint-set forests were first described by Bernard A. Galler and
  Michael J. Fischer in 1964 in their
  paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/364099.364331"><i>An improved
  equivalence algorithm</i></a>.
</p>

<p>
  The interface to a disjoint-set data structure that is described in
  this SRFI has been modelled on
  the <a href="https://www.smlnj.org/doc/smlnj-lib/Manual/uref.html"><code>UREF</code>
  signature of SML/NJ</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Olin Shivers has used the disjoint-set data structure, which is
  implemented by this SRFI, in Scheme code that generates random
  mazes.  The code and the description of the algorithm
  is <a href="https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/shivers/mazes.html">available
  on Olin Shiver's web site</a>.  Thanks to Arthur A. Gleckler for
  pointing this (practical) use of disjoint sets out to me.
