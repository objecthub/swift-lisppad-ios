<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>Compound objects are analogous to R6RS compound conditions,
and are suitable for use in creating and handling conditions
on non-R6RS systems, among other purposes.
They encapsulate an immutable sequence of subobjects, which can be
any object except another compound object.
It is possible to implement R6RS compound conditions on top of
compound objects, but not vice versa.
Note that this SRFI does not provide any analogue to R6RS
<i>simple</i> conditions, which are just records.

<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>Compound objects serve as a kind of poor man's multiple inheritance
without the usual complications of multiple inheritance.
A compound object can
be used to represent multiple otherwise unrelated aspects of a value
or situation.
Because they are sequences, they can be used to
represent priorities of interpretation from higher to lower.  Most
of the operations described
in this section treat a non-compound object identically to a compound
object with the simple object as its sole component.</p>

(define-record-type &lt;student&gt;
  (student admission-year gpa)
  student?
  (admission-year admission-year)

<h3>Procedures</h3>
<p><code>(make-compound </code> <em>obj</em> ...<code>)</code></p>
<p>Create a compound object
containing the objects in <em>obj...</em> in the specified order.
If any object in <em>obj...</em> is itself a compound object,
it is flattened into its subobjects,
which are then added to the compound object in sequence.

(define george
  (make-compound
    'teaching-assistant
    (student 1979 3.8)
    (teacher 1983 1000)))

(define (teaching-assistant? obj)
  (eq? obj 'teaching-assistant))

</pre></blockquote>
<p><code>(compound? </code><em>obj</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns <code>#t</code> if <em>obj</em> is a compound object, and <code>#f</code> otherwise.
[R6RS analogue: <code>condition?</code>]
<blockquote><pre>(compound? alyssa) =&gt; #f
(compound? george) =&gt; #t
</pre></blockquote>
<p><code>(compound-subobjects </code><em>obj</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>If <em>obj</em> is a compound object, returns a list of its subobjects;
otherwise, returns a list containing only <em>obj</em>.
[R6RS analogue: <code>simple-conditions</code>]
<blockquote><pre>(compound-subobjects alyssa) =&gt; (#&lt;student&gt;)
(compound-subobjects george) =&gt; (teaching-assistant #&lt;student&gt; #&lt;teacher&gt;)
</pre></blockquote>
<p><code>(compound-length </code><em>obj</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>If <em>obj</em> is a compound object, returns the number of its subobjects as an exact
integer.  Otherwise, it returns 1.</p>
<blockquote><pre>(compound-length alyssa) =&gt; 1
(compound-length george) =&gt; 3
</pre></blockquote>
<p><code>(compound-ref </code><em>obj k</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>If <em>obj</em> is a compound object, returns the <em>k</em>th subobject.
Otherwise, <em>obj</em> is returned.
In either case, it is an error if <em>k</em> is less than
zero, or greater than or equal to <code>(compound-length </code><em>obj</em><code>)</code>.</p>
<blockquote><pre>(compound-ref alyssa 0) =&gt; #&lt;student&gt;
(compound-ref george 2) =&gt; #&lt;teacher&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p><code>(compound-map </code><em>mapper obj</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>If <em>obj</em> is a compound object, returns a compound object
whose subobjects result from invoking <em>mapper</em> on each subobject of <em>obj</em>.
Although the subobjects of the result are in the same order as the subobjects of <em>obj</em>,
the order in which <em>mapper</em> is applied to them is unspecified.
If any resulting subobject is itself a compound object, it is flattened into its subobjects,
which are then added to the result in sequence.</p>
<p>If <em>obj</em> is not a compound object, returns a compound object
whose only subobject is the result of applying <em>mapper</em> to <em>obj</em>.</p>
<blockquote><pre>(compound-map - (compound 1 2 3 4 5)) =&gt; #&lt;compound: -1 -2 -3 -4 -5&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p><code>(compound-map-&gt;list </code><em>mapper obj</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>If <em>obj</em> is a compound object, returns a list
whose elements result from invoking <em>mapper</em> on each subobject of <em>obj</em>.
Although the elements of the result are in the same order as the subobjects of <em>obj</em>,
the order in which <em>mapper</em> is applied to them is unspecified.</p>
<p>If <em>obj</em> is not a compound object, returns a list
whose only element is the result of applying <em>mapper</em> to <em>obj</em>.</p>
<blockquote><pre>(compound-map-&gt;list - (compound 1 2 3 4 5)) =&gt; (-1 -2 -3 -4 -5)
</pre></blockquote>
<p><code>(compound-filter </code><em>pred</em> <em>obj</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns a compound object
It contains the subobjects of <em>obj</em> that satisfy <em>pred</em>.</p>
<p>If <em>obj</em> is not a compound object, it returns a compound object.
If <em>obj</em> satisfies <em>pred</em>, the only subobject of the result is <em>obj</em>.
If <em>obj</em> does not satisfy <em>pred</em>, the result has no subobjects.</p>
<blockquote><pre>(compound-filter teacher? alyssa) =&gt; #&lt;compound&gt;
(compound-filter teacher? george) =&gt;
  #&lt;compound: #&lt;teacher&gt;&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p><code>(compound-predicate </code><em>pred obj</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>If <em>obj</em> satisfies <em>pred</em>,
or is a compound object and
at least one of its subobjects satisfies <em>pred</em>,
then returns <code>#t</code>; otherwise returns <code>#f</code>.
[R6RS analogue: <code>condition-predicate</code>]
<blockquote><pre>
(compound-predicate student? alyssa) =&gt; #t

(compound-predicate teaching-assistant? guy) =&gt; #f
(compound-predicate teaching-assistant? george) =&gt; #t
</pre></blockquote>
<p><code>(compound-access </code><em>predicate accessor default obj</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>If <em>obj</em> satisfies <em>obj</em>, <em>accessor</em> is applied to
<em>obj</em> and the result is returned.
Otherwise, if <em>obj</em> is a compound object, <em>accessor</em> is applied to
the first subobject that satisfies <em>obj</em>, and the result is returned.
Otherwise, <em>default</em> is returned.
[R6RS analogue: <code>condition-accessor</code>]
<blockquote><pre>
(define (uni-member-hire-year obj)
  (compound-access teacher? hire-year #f obj))
