<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>This SRFI defines the trivial type <i>timespec</i>, which is used
to represent the <code>struct timespec</code> defined by the
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/time.h.html">
P<small>OSIX</small> <code>&lt;time.h&gt;</code> header</a>.</p>

<h1>Issues</h1>

None at present.

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<p>The reason for putting this very simple and straightforward type
into a SRFI (and library) of its own is that timespecs are part of the
interface for more than one SRFI.  If they are defined in just
one SRFI and imported by the rest, that produces an otherwise useless
and unnecessary dependency on the defining SRFI.  This arises particularly
in R6RS and R7RS because record types are generative (distinct
definitions lead to distinct record types) and because most implementations
report a warning or even an error if the same identifier is imported from
different libraries, unless they have both imported it in turn
from the same original library.</p>

<h1>Specification</h1>

<p>Timespec is a type that contains two values.
The first is the number of seconds
since a particular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(computing)">
epoch</a>, but normally excluding all leap seconds that have occurred since then.
The second is the number of nanoseconds since the beginning of the
specified second.  It is recommended, but not required, that timespecs
are a disjoint type, but for efficiency's sake they may be represented
otherwise in particular implementations.  If they are not disjoint, the
exact representation (such as a pair) must be documented
by the implementation.</p>

<h2>Procedures</h2>

<p><code>(timespec </code><i>seconds nanoseconds</i><code>)</code></p>

<p>Returns a timespec containing <i>seconds</i> and <i>nanoseconds</i>.

<p><code>(timespec? </code><i>obj</i><code>)</code></p>

<p>Returns <code>#f</code> if <i>obj</i> is definitely not a timespec,
and <code>#t</code> if it is most probably one.</p>

<p>If timespecs are a disjoint type, this procedure simply tests whether
<i>obj</i> belongs to that type.  If not, then each component
is checked to see if it is an exact integer, and in the case
of the nanoseconds component, whether it is a non-positive integer
less than 1,000,000,000.  In addition, on 64-bit Schemes, the
integers will almost certainly be fixnums for all times in the
past or future one billion years, which is certainly sufficient in
practice, so a check for fixnum status (if possible) will provide additional
certitude.</p>

<p><code>(timespec-seconds </code><i>timespec</i>)</code></p>

<p>Returns the seconds component of <i>timespec</i>.</p>

<p><code>(timespec-nanoseconds </code><i>timespec</i>)</code></p>

<p>Returns the nanoseconds component of <i>timespec</i>.</p>

<p><code>timespec-comparator</code></p>

<p>This variable (not a procedure) is a comparator object for
timespecs, ordering them by the total number of nanoseconds.
A simple hash function is also provided.</p>

<p>Note that it is an (undetectable) error to compare two
timespecs that are relative to different epochs.</p>

<h1>Implementation</h1>

<p>Two implementations of SRFI 174 are in the repository of this SRFI.
The files are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>srfi/174.sld</code> - uses a disjoint type</li>
<li><code>srfi/pair-174.sld</code> - uses a pair</li>
<li><code>chibi-tests.scm</code> - Tests using <code>(chibi tests)</code></li>
<li><code>chibi-tests-pair.scm</code> - Tests for <code>(srfi pair-174)</code></li>
</ul>


<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>

<p>Discussions between me, Lassi Kortela, and Harold Ancell, mostly on the
<a href="https://srfi-email.schemers.org/srfi-170/">SRFI 170
mailing list</a>, made the need for this SRFI clear.</p>
