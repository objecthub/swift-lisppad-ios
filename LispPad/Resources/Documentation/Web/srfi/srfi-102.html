<h1><a name="Abstract">Abstract</a></h1>

<p>
Many Scheme systems provide mechanisms for inspecting the arity of a
procedural value, making it a common feature, however there is no
standard interface.  As a result there is no portable way to observe
the arity of a procedure <em>without actually applying it</em>.  This
SRFI proposes a simple interface that is consistent with existing
Scheme systems' facilities and prior proposals.
</p>

<h1><a name="Issues">Issues</a></h1>

<div>
<ul>
  <li>
    Should arity normalization be specified?  I.e., there are an
    infinite number of ways to represent the same arity information for
    any given procedure (except for a procedure that accepts no arguments,
    which has a unique representation).  Should some notion of arity
    normal forms be defined?
  </li>
  <li>
    Should keywords be considered in this SRFI?
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h1><a name="Rationale">Rationale</a></h1>

<p>
This proposal identifies a common, core set of operations that make it
possible to inspect the arity of procedures and determine if a given
procedure accepts a given number of arguments.  These operations are
already supported in several Scheme systems and it should be easy to
add support in many more systems.
</p>

<p>
In preparing this proposal, the facilities available in Chez
[<a href="#note-1">1</a>], Gauche [<a href="#note-2">2</a>],
IronScheme [<a href="#note-3">3</a>], Larceny
[<a href="#note-4">4</a>], MIT/GNU Scheme [<a href="#note-5">5</a>],
PLT Scheme [<a href="#note-6">6</a>], and s7 [<a href="#note-7">7</a>]
were reviewed.  Also relevant is William D Clinger's 1996 straw
proposal sent to the RnRS Authors mailing list
[<a href="#note-8">8</a>].  Although there is some overlap among these
systems, there are also many differences, precluding portability of
code that relies on arity inspection.  The most overlap occurs between
Gauche, PLT Scheme, Larceny, and Clinger's proposal, and this forms
the basis of this proposal.  In particular, PLT Scheme and Gauche
already implement this SRFI.  Larceny implements a subset of this SRFI
that makes it easy to portably define the remaining components and any
Scheme that implements Clinger's proposal can likewise be easily and
portably extended to implement this SRFI (such an extension is
provided in the
<a href="#ReferenceImplementation">reference implementation</a>
section).  The remaining systems provide interfaces in which this
proposal is easily implemented.
</p>

<p>
A procedure to determine the arity of an arbitrary procedure's value
was discussed briefly, without result, at the June 1992 RnRS Authors
meeting [<a href="#note-9">9</a>].

In October 1995, version 0.29 of MzScheme added the <code>arity</code>
procedure for inspecting the arity of a procedure
[<a href="#note-10">10</a>].  That interface, which is the first this
SRFI author was able to locate that includes support for Dybvig and
Hieb's <code>case-lambda</code> form [<a href="#note-11">11</a>], is
still supported in the current version of PLT Scheme
(renamed <code>procedure-arity</code>) and has also been adopted by
Gauche.

In May 1996, William D Clinger submitted a straw proposal to the RnRS
Authors mailing list [<a href="#note-8">8</a>].  Shortly afterward
[<a href="#note-12">12</a>], Shriram Krishnamurthi suggested the
proposal take into account the possibility of extending Scheme
with <code>case-lambda</code> (which came to pass with the
finalization of SRFI 16 [<a href="#note-13">13</a>] and again with the
ratification of R6RS Standard Libraries [<a href="#note-14">14</a>]),
in which a procedure has multiple traditional arities.

Clinger's 1996 proposal for inspecting arities largely overlaps with
this SRFI.  The major differences are that Clinger's proposal:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    includes other procedure inspection facilities beyond the scope of
    this proposal;
  </li>
  <li>
    does not include support for procedures with disjoint arities,
    i.e., procedures constructed with the <code>case-lambda</code>
    syntax of Dybvig and Hieb, SRFI 16, and R6RS; and
  </li>
  <li>
    specifies that the arity of procedures accepting <em>n</em> or
    more arguments is represented by the inexact number <em>n</em>,
    while this proposal allows for such a representation, but does not
    require it.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
Following Clinger's proposal, Scheme systems need not provide complete
information for the arity of all procedures.  There will be
implementations for which this kind of information can always be
provided, but there will also be systems or modes of operation in
which this kind of information is not appropriate.  Thus this SRFI
specifies an interface only, and makes very few guarantees about what
an implementation must produce when used.  Scheme implementations are
encouraged to document the guarantees supported in their particular
implementation beyond those described here, if any.  Portable programs
should not depend on the behaviour of this feature beyond what is
specified in this document.
</p>

<p>
Many Scheme systems provide procedure inspection facilities beyond
arity inspection.  For example, many Schemes provide mechanisms for
recovering source code, source location, and documentation.  This SRFI
focuses solely on the ability to retrieve arity information from
procedural values; features for retrieving other kinds of information
from procedures are considered beyond the scope of this proposal and
left for future SRFIs to take up.
</p>

<p>
Many Scheme systems provide a library of operations for procedural
values.  For example, many Schemes provide library procedures for
composing, currying, and iterating procedures.  A general library for
procedures is considered beyond the scope of this proposal and left
for future SRFIs.
</p>

<p>
At least one Scheme system, PLT Scheme, provides operations for
restricting the set of acceptable arities for a procedure.  These
operations do not seem to be in wide use (outside of PLT) and are
therefore not considered in this proposal.
</p>

<h2><em>Caveat Emptor</em></h2>

<p>
Inspecting procedure arity is not without its caveats and there are
good reasons for <em>not</em> supporting such a feature.  This section
outlines some of those reason.  The following analysis was developed
during a conversation with R. Kent Dybvig and has been lightly edited.
</p>

<p>
An arity-reporting procedure may be misleading because it appears to
but does not actually guarantee that an arity error will not occur
when a procedure is called with an arity it is reported to accept (in
fact, all that is guaranteed is that if a procedure is applied to
arguments it is reported <em>not</em> to accept, an arity error is
guaranteed to occur).  It is common for a procedure to be a wrapper
for one or more other procedures (for tracing, dispatch, or other
reasons), to take an arbitrary number of arguments, and to apply one
of the wrapped procedures to those arguments.  This occurs, for
example, when using the reference implementation
of <code>case-lambda</code> given in SRFI 16 or the implementation
given in R6RS.  The effective number of arguments is that of the
wrapped procedure that is actually called, but an arity-reporting
procedure would report the number of arguments of the wrapping
procedure.
</p>

<p>
Before using a procedure, it is necessary to know how many arguments
it takes, their types, the ranges of acceptable values, and of course
what it will and will not do.  An arity-reporting procedure seems like
a drop in the bucket and may not even be as useful as it seems at
first blush.
</p>

<p>
A more subtle issue is that the mere existence of an arity-reporting
procedure and the like might discourage people from using wrappers
such as described, insidiously reducing a language's expressiveness
even as they seem to increase it.
</p>

<h1><a name="Specification">Specification</a></h1>

<p>
An <em>arity</em> object represents the arity of a procedure.  An
arity object is either <code>#f</code>, an exact non-negative integer,
an arity-at-least object, or a list of exact non-negative integers and
arity-at-least objects.
</p>

<p>
An <em>arity-at-least</em> object represents the arity (or one of the
arities) of a procedure that accepts some number or more arguments.
This proposal does not specify the representation of arity-at-least
objects, other than to say that it must be disjoint from exact,
non-negative integers; lists; and <code>#f</code>; and it must satisfy
the requirements below.
</p>

<p class="proto">
procedure: <code>(procedure-arity <em>proc</em>) &rarr; <em>arity</em></code>
</p>

<p>
Produces an arity object representing the arity of <em>proc</em>.  If
this procedure produces <code>#f</code>, no information is available
for <em>proc</em>. 
</p>

<p>
If this procedure produces an exact non-negative integer, <em>k</em>,
then <em>proc</em> accepts exactly <em>k</em> arguments;
applying <em>proc</em> to some number of arguments other
than <em>k</em> will result in an arity error.
</p>

<p>
If this procedure produces an arity-at-least object, <em>a</em>,
then <em>proc</em>
accepts <code>(arity-at-least-value <em>a</em>)</code> or more
arguments; applying <em>proc</em> to some number of arguments less
than <code>(arity-at-least-value <em>a</em>)</code> will result in an
arity error.
</p>

<p>
If this procedure produces a list, then <em>proc</em> accepts any of
the arities described by the elements of the list;
applying <em>proc</em> to some number of arguments not described by an
element of the list will result in an arity error.
</p>

<p class="proto">
procedure: <code>(arity-at-least? <em>obj</em>) &rarr; <em>bool</em></code>
</p>

<p>
Returns <code>#t</code> if <em>obj</em> is an arity-at-least object
and false otherwise.
</p>

<p class="proto">
procedure: <code>(arity-at-least-value <em>arity-at-least</em>) &rarr;
<em>k</em></code>
</p>

<p>
Returns the exact non-negative integer denoting the minimum number of
arguments required by the given <em>arity-at-least</em> object.
</p>

<p class="proto">
procedure: <code>(procedure-arity-includes? <em>proc</em> <em>k</em>)
&rarr; <em>bool</em></code>
</p>

<p>
Returns <code>#t</code> if the <em>proc</em> can accept <em>k</em>
arguments and <code>#f</code> otherwise.  If this procedure
returns <code>#f</code>, applying <em>proc</em> to <em>k</em>
arguments will result in an arity error.
</p>

<h1>
<a name="ReferenceImplementation">Reference Implementation</a>
</h1>

<p>
A portable reference implementation of this SRFI that provides useful
information is not possible.  In its place we offer a portable
implementation that does not provide useful information and
implementation-specific implementations that do for PLT Scheme (a
trivial wrapper for its native implementation of this interface) and
Larceny (a trivial extension for its native implementation, which is
sufficient for any Scheme that implements Clinger's 1996 proposal).
Like PLT Scheme, Gauche natively supports this SRFI.
