  <h1>Abstract</h1>
  <p>Many Scheme implementations have keyword arguments, but they
  have not been widely standardized. This SRFI defines the macros
  <code>keyword-lambda</code> and <code>keyword-call</code>. They
  can be used identically in every major implementation currently
  in use, making it safe to use keyword arguments in portable code.
  The macros expand to native keyword arguments in Schemes that
  have them, letting programmers mix portable code and
  implementation-specific code.</p>

  <h1 id="_rationale">Rationale</h1>
  <h2 id="_why_keywords">Why keywords?</h2>
  <p>Keyword arguments are a very useful tool for managing
  complexity as programs grow. They are a natural solution to the
  "no, wait, this procedure still needs another argument" problem
  which is almost guaranteed to pop up many times over the lifetime
  of any non-trivial program. Humans simply cannot plan years ahead
  at this level of detail, and adding keyword arguments as an
  afterthought is less objectionable than accumulating long lists
  of optional positional arguments or refactoring central APIs
  every few years when third-party code depends on them.</p>
  <p>While the same information can be passed using records,
  keyword arguments are more convenient for simple jobs since a
  separate record type does not have to be defined for each
  procedure taking them. They are also less verbose at the call
  site since an extra <code>make-foo-record</code> call is not
  needed.</p>

  <h2 id="_standardization">Standardization</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Common Lisp (1994) has standard keyword arguments defined
      with <code>(lambda (foo &amp;key bar) ...)</code> and
      supplied with <code>:bar</code> syntax. This has influenced
      some Scheme implementations.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>DSSSL (1996) is R<sup>4</sup>RS with some extensions, one
      of them being keyword arguments defined with <code>(lambda
      (foo #!key bar) ...​)</code> and supplied with
      <code>bar:</code> syntax.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>SRFI 88: <em>Keyword objects</em> (2007) is implemented in
      Gambit Scheme and based on the DSSSL keyword syntax.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>SRFI 89: <em>Optional positional and named parameters</em>
      (2007) specifies <code>define*</code> and
      <code>lambda*</code>, which can handle positional, optional,
      rest and keyword arguments. The result approaches the
      capabilities of Common Lisp function definitions, but also
      their complexity. Keywords use SRFI 88 syntax.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="_scheme_implementations_with_native_keywords">Scheme
  implementations with native keywords</h2>
  <p>These syntaxes work with the default settings of each Scheme
  at the time of writing. A couple of them optionally support an
  alternative read syntax for keywords.</p>

  <h2 id="_a_portable_approach">A portable approach</h2>
  <h3 id="_procedure_calls">Procedure calls</h3>
  <p>From the above table it is clear that there is no portable
  syntax to supply keyword arguments in a procedure call. While all
  of the implementations support the syntax <code>(proc arg1 arg2
  #:key3 arg3 #:key4 arg4)</code> with the keys in any order, the
  keyword prefix or suffix <code>#:</code> varies. On the other
  hand the implementations all have a low-level macro system, as
  well as procedures to turn symbols into keywords. Hence the
  easiest portable approach is to provide a macro that lets the
  caller use ordinary symbols instead of keywords for the read
  syntax. The symbols are then converted into the implementation’s
  native keyword syntax by the macro. The <code>keyword-call</code>
  procedure in this SRFI implements this pattern.</p>

  <h3 id="_procedure_definitions">Procedure definitions</h3>
  <p>The next problem is how to define procedures that take keyword
  arguments. Portable code cannot use any syntax that requires
  keyword objects in the lambda list, since as noted above there is
  no portable representation. Here too we need to use symbols in
  place of keywords. For most of the implementations with native
  keywords, we need to insert the constant <code>#!key</code> or
  <code>#:key</code> into the lambda list. This turns out to be
  trivially easy in all of them. For a few implementations, we need
  to turn each keyword symbol <code>bar</code> into <code>(bar
  #f)</code> to ensure that the default value is <code>#f</code>
  instead of undefined. Finally, Racket requires an exotic syntax
  <code>#:bar (bar #f)</code> where the keyword’s name appears
  twice (once as a keyword and again as a symbol). This is easy to
  code as well.</p>

  <h3 id="_emulating_keywords_in_schemes_that_don_t_have_them">
  Emulating keywords in Schemes that don’t have them</h3>
  <p>For Schemes that don’t have keyword arguments, the best
  approach is to use a rest argument as in <code>(lambda (arg1 arg2
  . kvs) ...​)</code>. This argument takes a property list of
  keywords and their values. As above, the keywords can be
  represented by standard Scheme symbols.</p>
  <p>Another approach would be to pass the keywords first:
  <code>(lambda (kvs arg1 arg2) ...​)</code>. This is not ideal
  since it’s really nice to be able to call a keyword procedure
  just like an ordinary procedure when you don’t supply any keyword
  arguments (i.e. they get default values). Using a rest argument
  preserves this property; using one or more preceding arguments
  does not. Using the rest argument for keywords implies that users
  cannot have their own rest argument or optional positional
  arguments. That's fine; the interplay of keywords with optional
  and rest arguments is somewhat confusing to most people anyway.
  And our keyword arguments are all optional, so a keyword argument
  can be used for any purpose an optional or rest argument
  might.</p>
  <p>The keyword arguments could be passed in a vector. We cannot
  do this because it’s not portable to use a vector as the rest
  argument to a procedure; it has to be a list.</p>
  <p>R<sup>5</sup>RS has the venerable
  <strong>syntax-rules</strong> pattern-matching hygienic macro
  system. It turns out to be powerful enough to implement keyword
  arguments without too much effort or duct tape. Since
  <strong>syntax-rules</strong> pattern matching is based mainly on
  list structure and we don’t have any portable keyword syntax, we
  have to rely solely on list structure to separate positional
  arguments from keyword arguments. With the ubiquitous <em>tail
  patterns</em> from SRFI 46 (<em>Basic syntax-rules
  extensions</em>) we can check whether the last element of a list
  is another list. Consequently we can achieve the syntax
  <code>(keyword-lambda (pos1 pos2 (key3 key4)) ...​)</code> and
  <code>(keyword-call pos1 pos2 (key3 key4))</code>. This is
  reasonably simple and unambiguous.</p>

  <h1 id="_specification">Specification</h1>

  <h2 id="_summary">Summary</h2>
  <p>This SRFI provides <strong>keyword-lambda</strong> and
  <strong>keyword-call</strong> which are used as follows:</p>
  <pre><code>(define foo
  (keyword-lambda (a b (c d e))
    (list a b c d e)))

(foo 1 2)                             ; =&gt; (1 2 #f #f #f)
(apply foo 1 2 '())                   ; =&gt; (1 2 #f #f #f)
(keyword-call foo 1 2 ())             ; =&gt; (1 2 #f #f #f)
(keyword-call foo 1 2 (d 4))          ; =&gt; (1 2 #f 4 #f)
(keyword-call foo 1 2 (d 4 e 5))      ; =&gt; (1 2 #f 4 5)
(keyword-call foo 1 2 (e 5 c 3 d 4))  ; =&gt; (1 2 3 4 5)</code></pre>

  <h2 id="_details">Details</h2>
  <p>Syntax (<strong>keyword-lambda</strong> (<em>formals...​</em>
  (<em>keywords...​</em>)) <em>body...​</em>)</p>
  <p>Like <strong>lambda</strong>, but makes a procedure that can
  take keyword arguments in addition to positional arguments.</p>
  <p><em>formals</em> are zero or more symbols naming positional
  arguments. <em>keywords</em> are zero or more symbols naming
  keyword arguments. All positional arguments need to be supplied
  by the caller on every call. There is no way to define optional
  positional arguments or a rest argument. By contrast, all keyword
  arguments are optional. Every keyword argument takes on the
  default value <code>#f</code> when no value is supplied by the
  caller. There is no support for user-defined default values; this
  simplifies the syntax of keyword lambdas and makes it easier to
  write wrapper procedures for them since the wrapper can always
  pass <code>#f</code> to any keyword argument it does not use.</p>
  <p><em>body</em> is evaluated as if in the context
  (<strong>lambda</strong> (...​) <em>body...​</em>) so anything
  that can go at the beginning of a lambda can go at the beginning
  of <em>body</em>. But the lambda around <em>body</em> may be
  wrapped inside another lambda depending on the implementation.
  Within <em>body</em>, all of the arguments in <em>formals</em>
  and <em>keywords</em> can be accessed as variables using the
  symbols given by the user.</p>
  <p>The returned procedure <em>p</em> can be called in any way
  that an ordinary procedure can, e.g. (<em>p</em>
  <em>formals...​</em>) or (<strong>apply</strong> <em>p</em>
  <em>formals</em>). If the number of arguments given to the
  procedure is equal to the number of <em>formals</em>, all keyword
  arguments take on the default value <code>#f</code>. Giving more
  arguments than that results in undefined behavior. To supply a
  value for one or more keyword arguments in a well-defined and
  portable way, call <em>p</em> via (<strong>keyword-call</strong>
  <em>p</em> <em>formals</em> ...​ (<em>keyword1</em>
  <em>value1</em> ...​)). There may be additional
  implementation-defined ways to call <em>p</em>.</p>
  <p>Syntax (<strong>keyword-call</strong> <em>kw-lambda</em>
  <em>args</em>...​ (<em>kw-args</em>...​))</p>
  <p>This macro expands to a call to <em>kw-lambda</em> with zero
  or more positional arguments <em>args</em> and zero or more
  keyword arguments <em>kw-args</em>. It is an error to pass a
  different number of <em>args</em> than the number of positional
  arguments expected by <em>kw-lambda</em>.</p>
  <p>Keyword arguments may be passed in any combination, and in any
  order. It is valid to supply no <em>kw-args</em> at all. It is an
  error to have duplicate keywords in <em>kw-args</em>. As with
  ordinary procedure calls in Scheme, nothing is guaranteed about
  the evaluation order of <em>args</em> and <em>kw-args</em>. For a
  guaranteed evaluation order, bind arguments with
  <strong>let</strong>* before passing them in.</p>
  <p>Each keyword argument in <em>kw-args</em> is written as two
  forms: <em>keyword</em> <em>value</em>. Each <em>keyword</em> is
  written as a standard Scheme symbol and is implicitly quoted
  (i.e. it has to be a symbol at read time; cannot be some other
  expression that evaluates to a symbol). The symbols are
  internally converted to native keywords in implementations that
  have them.</p>

  <h1 id="_implementation">Implementation</h1>
  <p>The sample implementation covers the following Scheme
  implementations that each have their own kind of native
  keywords:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bigloo</li>
    <li>Chicken</li>
    <li>Gambit</li>
    <li>Gauche</li>
    <li>Guile</li>
    <li>Kawa</li>
    <li>Racket</li>
    <li>S7</li>
    <li>Sagittarius</li>
    <li>STklos</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There is also a generic R<sup>5</sup>RS implementation
  (relying on SRFI 46 tail patterns). This is used as the basis of
  generic R<sup>6</sup>RS and R<sup>7</sup>RS implementations for
  Schemes that don’t have native keywords.</p>
  <p>The generic R<sup>6</sup>RS implementation works on the
  following Schemes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Chez Scheme</li>
    <li>Ikarus</li>
    <li>IronScheme</li>
    <li>Larceny</li>
    <li>Loko Scheme</li>
    <li>Mosh</li>
    <li>Vicare</li>
    <li>Ypsilon</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The generic R<sup>7</sup>RS implementation works on the
  following Schemes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Chibi-Scheme</li>
    <li>Larceny</li>
  </ul>
