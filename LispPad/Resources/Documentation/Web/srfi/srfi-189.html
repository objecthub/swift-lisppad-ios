<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This SRFI defines two disjoint immutable container types
known as Maybe and Either,
both of which can contain objects collectively known as their payload.
A Maybe object is either a Just object or the unique object Nothing
(which has no payload); an Either object is either
a Right object or a Left object.  Maybe represents the concept of
optional values; Either represents the concept of values which are
either correct (Right) or errors (Left).</p>
<p>Note that the terms Maybe, Just, Nothing, Either, Right, and Left
are capitalized in this SRFI so as not to be confused with their
ordinary use as English words.  Thus &quot;returns Nothing&quot; means
&quot;returns the unique Nothing object&quot;; &quot;returns nothing&quot; could be
interpreted as &quot;returns no values&quot;
or &quot;returns an unspecified value&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>It is common for Scheme procedures that can either succeed or fail
to return a true value on success and <code>#f</code> on failure.  However, if
the procedure is able to return any value on success, there is no
way to distinguish between a successful return of <code>#f</code> and failure.
For example, the SRFI 1 procedure <code>find</code> returns <code>#f</code>
when it fails, but that makes using
it to search for <code>#f</code> in a list impossible.
What is more, it is easy for the programmer to write code in which
success is assumed and the special case of <code>#f</code> is not handled
correctly; thus when using a procedure which returns a number or <code>#f</code>, like
<code>string-&gt;number</code>, the programmer may assume it will always return a number,
thus causing a dynamic type error when it does not.</p>
<p>By returning a Maybe instead, a procedure can unambiguously distinguish
between success, which returns a Just object, and failure, which
returns Nothing.  Furthermore, the returned value cannot be further
processed without removing it from its Just container except by
procedures that are Maybe-aware; a number wrapped in a Just is not
a number and has to be unwrapped to be used as a number.</p>
<p>Either is closely related to Maybe, and Right is closely related to Just.
However, a Left is a container for an object which indicates
<em>why</em> a procedure returning an Either failed, whereas Nothing indicates
only a failure.
Some of the Either-accepting procedures in this SRFI treat Left and Right asymmetrically;
specifically, a Left is considered empty by the join, bind, and sequence
procedures, and the <code>either-ref</code> procedure by default unwraps a Right
but raises the payload of a Left as an exception.
It is also possible to use Left and Right simply as two
distinguishable types of container for a single value,
or to interchange the roles of Left and
Right with the special constructor <code>either-swap</code>.</p>
<p>Because the procedures of Scheme, unlike the functions of ML and Haskell,
accept multiple arguments and return multiple values, this SRFI allows
a Just, Left, or Right container to hold more than one object,
or indeed no objects at all.  In particular, a Just containing no objects
is not the same as a Nothing: it represents success when there are
no actual values to return, as in a procedure called solely for effect.
The specification presented here, therefore, differs in several ways
from its analogues in other languages.</p>
<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>
<p>The four types Just, Nothing, Left, and Right are disjoint from each
other and from all other Scheme types.</p>
<p>We speak of unwrapping a container when we extract its payload, and wrapping
values in a container when we create the container with the values as its
payload.</p>
<p>The following names are used for the arguments:</p>
<p><em>obj, default</em>: Any Scheme object.</p>
<p><em>maybe</em>: A Maybe object.</p>
<p><em>either</em>: An Either object.</p>
<p><em>failure</em>: A procedure that accepts zero arguments (unless specified otherwise).</p>
<p><em>success</em>: A procedure that accepts one or more arguments.</p>
<p><em>pred</em>: A predicate that accepts zero or more arguments.</p>
<p><em>equal</em>: A predicate that accepts two arguments
and returns a boolean value.  It is not necessarily an equivalence relation.</p>
<p><em>proc</em>: A procedure that accepts zero or more arguments and returns
zero or more values.</p>
<p><em>mproc</em>: A procedure that accepts zero or more arguments
and returns zero or more values wrapped in a single Maybe or Either container.</p>
<p><em>list</em>: A Scheme list.</p>
<p><em>producer</em>: A procedure that accepts no arguments and returns
some number of values.</p>
<p>It is an error (unless otherwise noted) if the procedures are passed arguments
that do not have the type implied by the argument names.</p>
<h3 id="constructors">Constructors</h3>
<p><code>(just</code> <em>obj</em> ...<code>)</code></p>
<p>Monadic pure.  Returns the <em>objs</em> wrapped in a Just.</p>
<p><code>(nothing)</code></p>
<p>Returns the unique Nothing object.</p>
<p><code>(right</code> <em>obj</em> ...<code>)</code></p>
<p>Monadic pure.  Returns the <em>objs</em> wrapped in a Right.</p>
<p><code>(left</code> <em>obj</em> ...<code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns the <em>objs</em> wrapped in a Left.</p>
<p><code>(list-&gt;just</code> <em>list</em><code>)</code><br>
<code>(list-&gt;left</code> <em>list</em><code>)</code><br>
<code>(list-&gt;right</code> <em>list</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns a Just / Left / Right whose values are the elements
of <em>list</em>.  Note that these procedures are not monadic;
they are equivalent to <code>just/left/right</code> but accept
a list rather than multiple arguments.
There is no need for <code>list-&gt;nothing</code> distinct
from <code>nothing</code>.</p>
<p><code>(maybe-&gt;either</code> <em>maybe obj</em> ...<code>)</code></p>
<p>If <em>maybe</em> is a Just, returns a Right with the same payload objects
in the sense of <code>eqv?</code>; otherwise returns a Left of <em>objs</em>.</p>
<p><code>(either-&gt;maybe</code> <em>either</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>If <em>either</em> is a Right, returns a Just with the same payload objects
in the sense of <code>eqv?</code>; otherwise returns Nothing.</p>
<p><code>(either-swap</code> <em>either</em><code>)</code>
<p>If <em>either</em> is a Left, return a Right with the same payload objects
(in the sense of <code>eqv?</code>), and vice versa.
<h3 id="predicates">Predicates</h3>
<p><code>(just?</code> <em>obj</em><code>)</code><br>
<code>(nothing?</code> <em>obj</em><code>)</code><br>
<code>(right?</code> <em>obj</em><code>)</code><br>
<code>(left?</code> <em>obj</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns <code>#t</code> if <em>obj</em> is a Just, Nothing, Left, or Right
respectively, and <code>#f</code> otherwise.</p>
<p><code>(maybe?</code> <em>obj</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns <code>#t</code> if <em>obj</em> is a Maybe (that is, either a Just or Nothing)
and <code>#f</code> otherwise.</p>
<p><code>(either?</code> <em>obj</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns <code>#t</code> if <em>obj</em> is an Either (that is, either a Right or a Left)
and <code>#f</code> otherwise.</p>
<p><code>(maybe=</code> <em>equal maybe1 maybe2 ...</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns <code>#t</code> if all <em>maybes</em> are Nothing, or if they all
are Justs and their respective payload objects
are the same in the sense of <em>equal</em>,
and <code>#f</code> otherwise.</p>
<p><code>(either=</code> <em>equal either1 either2 ...</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns <code>#t</code> if all <em>eithers</em> are all Lefts or all Rights
and their respective payload objects are the same in the sense of <em>equal</em>,
and <code>#f</code> otherwise.</p>
<h3 id="accessors">Accessors</h3>
<p><code>(maybe-ref</code> <em>maybe</em> <em>failure</em> [<em>success</em>]<code>)</code></p>
<p>If <em>maybe</em> is a Just, tail-calls the procedure <em>success</em>
on the values of its payload and returns the result.  Otherwise, it
tail-calls the procedure <em>failure</em> on no arguments and
returns the result.
The default value of <em>success</em> is <code>values</code>.</p>
<p><code>(either-ref</code> <em>either</em> <em>failure</em> [<em>success</em>]<code>)</code></p>
<p>If <em>either</em> is a Right, tail-calls the procedure <em>success</em>
on the values of its payload and returns the result.  Otherwise, it
tail-calls the procedure <em>failure</em>
on the values of its payload and returns the result.
The default value of <em>success</em> is <em>values</em>.</p>
<p><code>(maybe-ref/default</code> <em>maybe default</em> ...<code>)</code><br>
<code>(either-ref/default</code> <em>either default</em> ...<code>)</code></p>
<p>If <em>maybe/either</em> is a Just/Right, returns the values of its payload; otherwise
returns the <em>defaults</em> as multiple values.</p>
<h3 id="join-and-bind">Join and bind</h3>
<p><code>(maybe-join</code> <em>maybe</em><code>)</code><br>
<code>(either-join</code> <em>either</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Monadic join.  If <em>maybe/either</em> is a Just/Right whose single payload object is a Maybe/Either,
returns that payload; if it is a Nothing/Left, returns <em>maybe/either</em>.
In all other cases (including a Just/Right with multiple values) it is an error.  Thus
<code>(maybe-join (just (just</code> <em>x</em><code>))</code> returns Just <em>x</em> and
<code>(maybe-join (just (nothing))</code> returns Nothing,
and similarly for <code>either-join</code>.
<p><code>(maybe-compose</code> <em>mproc1 mproc2</em> ...<code>)</code><br>
<code>(either-compose</code> <em>mproc1 mproc2</em> ...<code>)</code>  </p>
<p>Returns an mproc that accepts zero or more arguments and
applies the following iterative algorithm to each <em>mproc</em>:</p>
<p>The <em>mproc</em> is applied to the arguments and returns a Maybe/Either interim result.
If the result is Nothing / a Left, it is returned as the final result.
If it is a Just/Right, the next <em>mproc</em> is applied to the values of its payload,
returning the next interim result.
When no more <em>mprocs</em> are available,
the interim result is returned as the final result.</p>
<p>It is an error if one of the <em>mprocs</em> does not accept as arguments the
number of values wrapped in the Just/Right produced by its predecessor.</p>
<p><code>(maybe-bind</code> <em>maybe mproc1 mproc2</em> ...<code>)</code><br>
<code>(either-bind</code> <em>either mproc1 mproc2</em> ...<code>)</code>  </p>
<p>Monadic bind.  If <em>maybe/either</em> is a Just/Right,
it behaves as if <code>maybe-compose/either-compose</code>
were applied to <em>mprocs</em>, and the resulting mproc
applied to the payload of <em>maybe/either</em>.
But if <em>maybe/either</em> is a Nothing/Left, it
is immediately returned.</p>
<h3 id="sequence-operations">Sequence operations</h3>
<p>These procedures treat Maybes (and in some cases Eithers)
as sequences of length 0 or 1.  This length depends only on the type
of the container and not on the number of objects it contains.</p>
<p><code>(maybe-length</code> <em>maybe</em><code>)</code><br>
<code>(either-length</code> <em>either</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Return 1 if <em>maybe/either</em> is a Just/Right, and 0 otherwise.</p>
<p><code>(maybe-filter</code> <em>pred maybe</em><code>)</code><br>
<code>(maybe-remove</code> <em>pred maybe</em><code>)</code><br>
<code>(either-filter</code> <em>pred either obj</em> ...<code>)</code><br>
<code>(either-remove</code> <em>pred either obj</em> ...<code>)</code></p>
<p>If <em>maybe/either</em> is a Just/Right and the values of its payload
satisfy / do not satisfy <em>pred</em>, then
return <em>maybe</em>; otherwise, returns Nothing / a Left of <em>objs</em>.</p>
<p><code>(maybe-sequence</code> <em>mappable map [aggregator]</em><code>)</code><br>
<code>(either-sequence</code> <em>mappable map [aggregator]</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>The purpose of these procedures is to transform a
collection of Maybes/Eithers of some particular type into a Maybe/Either
of a collection, often of the same type.</p>
<p>The <em>mappable</em> argument is the collection to be transformed,
and the <em>map</em> argument is the appropriate procedure that can
transform it, one element at a time.
The signature of <em>map</em> is <code>(</code><em>map proc mappable</em><code>)</code>,
where <em>proc</em> is supplied by the implementation.
Typical mappables are lists and vectors, and <code>map</code> and <code>vector-map</code>
are useful map functions, though not the only possible ones.</p>
<p>Each element is processed as follows:  If it is a Just/Right, its values are
unwrapped and the <em>aggregator</em> function (which defaults to <code>list</code>)
is applied to them.
But if it is a Left/Nothing, that object is immediately returned as the value of
<code>maybe-sequence/either-sequence</code>.</p>
<p>Assuming there are no Lefts/Nothings, the <em>map</em> function is then responsible
for constructing the new mappable out of the results of the calls on <em>aggregator</em>.</p>
<p>For example, a list of Justs becomes a Just list of lists if
the map procedure is <code>map</code> and the aggregator is <code>list</code>.
In the same way, a vector of Rights containing one value each becomes
a Right vector if the map procedure is <code>vector-map</code>
and the aggregator is <code>(lambda (x) x)</code>.</p>
<h3 id="protocolconversion">Protocol Conversion</h3>
<p>The use of <code>-&gt;</code> in a Scheme procedure name generally
indicates that the procedure converts, sometimes lossily, between
one type of object and another.  For example, <code>list-&gt;vector</code>
accepts a list and returns a vector containing the same elements
(in the sense of <code>eqv?</code>) in the same order.</p>
<p>In this section, however, <code>-&gt;</code> is used
in an extended sense.  As noted in the Rationale,
the purpose of Maybe and Either is to provide first-class objects
representing the distinction between success and failure in such a
way that any number of success values (and, in the case of Either,
any number of failure values) can be packaged up in a single object
without reserving any values to indicate success or failure.
A variety of <em>protocols</em> are already in use in Scheme and other Lisps
to more or less perfectly represent the distinction.  Some reserve a value to
represent failure which cannot be returned as a success value; some
handle only one success value; some are not first-class.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate communication between code using
Maybe/Either and code using another protocol,
these procedures convert between Maybe/Either objects
and some of the most usual protocols.  Conversion in either direction
is frequently lossy.</p>
<p><span class="big">&#9758;</span> The following procedures interface between the Maybe protocol
and the <em>list</em> protocol, which uses an empty list to represent failure
and a non-empty list to represent success.</p>
<p><code>(maybe-&gt;list</code> <em>maybe</em><code>)</code><br>
<code>(either-&gt;list</code> <em>either</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns a list whose elements are the payload of <em>maybe/either</em>;
if <em>maybe/either</em> is Nothing/Left, returns the empty list.
It is an error to mutate the result of this procedure.</p>
<p><code>(list-&gt;maybe</code> <em>list</em><code>)</code><br>
<code>(list-&gt;either</code> <em>list obj</em> ...<code>)</code></p>
<p>If <em>list</em> is empty,
returns Nothing / wraps <em>objs</em> in a Left and returns it;
otherwise, wraps the list elements in a Just/Right and returns that.</p>
<p><span class="big">&#9758;</span> The following procedures interface between the Maybe and Either protocols and
the <em>truth</em> protocol, which uses <code>#f</code> to represent failure
and a single true value to represent success.</p>
<p><code>(maybe-&gt;truth</code> <em>maybe</em><code>)</code><br>
<code>(either-&gt;truth</code> <em>either</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>If <em>maybe/either</em> is a Just/Right, returns its payload; otherwise returns <code>#f</code>.
It is an error if the Just/Right does not have exactly one value.</p>
<p><code>(truth-&gt;maybe</code> <em>obj</em><code>)</code><br>
<code>(truth-&gt;either</code> <em>obj fail-obj</em> ...<code>)</code></p>
<p>If <em>obj</em> is <code>#f</code>, return Nothing / a Left of <em>fail-objs</em>;
otherwise, return a Just/Right whose payload is <em>obj</em>.
<p><span class="big">&#9758;</span> The following procedures interface between the Maybe protocol
and the <em>list-truth</em> protocol, which uses <code>#f</code> to represent failure

<code>(either-&gt;list-truth</code> <em>either</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>If <em>maybe/either</em> is a Just/Right, returns a list whose elements are the payload;

It is an error to mutate the result of this procedure.</p>
<p><code>(list-truth-&gt;maybe</code> <em>list-or-false</em><code>)</code><br>
<code>(list-truth-&gt;either</code> <em>list-or-false obj ...</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>If <em>list-or-false</em> is <code>#f</code>,
returns Nothing / a Left of <em>objs</em>;
otherwise, wraps the list elements in a Just/Right and returns it.</p>
<p><span class="big">&#9758;</span> The following procedures interface between the Maybe and Either protocols
and the <em>generation</em> protocol, which uses an end-of-file object
to represent failure and any other value to represent success.</p>
<p><code>(maybe-&gt;generation</code> <em>maybe</em><code>)</code><br>
<code>(either-&gt;generation</code> <em>either</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>If <em>maybe/either</em> is a Just/Right, then its payload is returned.
It is an error if the Just/Right does not have exactly one value.
If <em>maybe/either</em> is Nothing / a Left,
then an end-of-file object is returned.</p>
<p><code>(generation-&gt;maybe</code> <em>obj</em><code>)</code><br>
<code>(generation-&gt;either</code> <em>obj fail-objs</em> ...<code>)</code></p>
If <em>obj</em> is an end-of-file object, return Nothing / a Left of <em>fail-objs</em>.
Otherwise, return <em>obj</em> wrapped in a Just/Right.
<p><span class="big">&#9758;</span> The following procedures interface between the Maybe and Either protocols
and the <em>values</em> protocol, which returns one or more values to represent success
and zero values to represent failure.</p>
<p><code>(maybe-&gt;values</code> <em>maybe</em><code>)</code><br>
<code>(either-&gt;values</code> <em>either</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>If <em>maybe/either</em> is a Just/Right, returns the values of its payload;

<p><code>(values-&gt;maybe</code> <em>producer</em><code>)</code><br>
<code>(values-&gt;either</code> <em>producer fail-obj</em> ...<code>)</code></p>
<p>These procedures invoke <em>producer</em> with no arguments.
If no values are returned, Nothing / Left of <em>fail-objs</em> is returned.
Otherwise the values are wrapped in a Just/Right and returned.</p>
<p><span class="big">&#9758;</span> The following procedures interface between the Maybe protocol
and the <em>two-values</em> protocol, which returns
<code>#f</code> and <code>#f</code> to represent failure and
a single value and <code>#t</code> to represent success.
(This protocol is more often used in Common Lisp, where additional values are
automatically discarded if the continuation expects only one.)</p>
<p><code>(maybe-&gt;two-values</code> <em>maybe</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>If <em>maybe</em> is a Just, returns the value of its payload and
the additional value <code>#t</code>;
otherwise returns two values, both <code>#f</code>.
It is an error if <em>maybe</em> does not have exactly one value.
<p><code>(two-values-&gt;maybe</code> <em>producer</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>This procedure is the inverse of <code>maybe-&gt;two-values</code>.
It invokes <em>producer</em> with no arguments.
If the second value is true, the first value
is wrapped in a Just and returned;
otherwise, Nothing is returned.</p>
<p><code>(exception-&gt;either</code> <em>pred thunk</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>This procedure is in a sense the inverse of <code>maybe-ref</code>.
A call to <em>thunk</em> is made, wrapped in an exception handler
that examines any exception signaled during <em>thunk's</em> execution.
If the condition object satisfies <em>pred</em>,
it is wrapped in a Left which is then returned;
if it does not, the exception is reraised.
But if no exception is raised, the values returned by <code>thunk</code>
are wrapped in a Right and the Right is returned.

<p><code>(maybe-map</code> <em>proc maybe</em><code>)</code><br>
<code>(either-map</code> <em>proc either</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Monadic map.  If <em>maybe/either</em> is a Just/Right, applies

returns <em>maybe/either</em>.</p>
<p><code>(maybe-for-each</code> <em>proc maybe</em><code>)</code><br>

<code>(either-for-each</code> <em>proc either</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>If <em>maybe/either</em> is a Just/Right, applies <em>proc</em>

<p>If <em>maybe/either</em> is a Just/Right, <em>kons</em> is invoked

<p><code>(maybe-unfold</code> <em>stop? mapper successor seed ...</em><code>)</code><br>
<code>(either-unfold</code> <em>stop? mapper successor seed ...</em><code>)</code></p>

<h3 id="syntax">Syntax</h3>
<p><code>(maybe-if</code> <em>maybe-expr just-expr nothing-expr</em><code>)</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;[syntax]</p>
Equivalent to <code>(if (just? </code><em>maybe-expr</em><code>) </code><em>just-expr nothing-expr</em><code>)</code>,
except that an error satisfying <code>error-object</code> is signaled
if <em>maybe-expr</em> does not evaluate to a Maybe.
<p><code>(maybe-and</code> <em>expr</em> ...<code>)</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;[syntax]<br>
<code>(either-and</code> <em>expr</em> ...<code>)</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;[syntax]</p>
The <em>exprs</em> are evaluated in order.
If an <em>expr</em> evaluates to a Nothing / Left, it is returned
without evaluating any more expressions.
Otherwise, the last Just / Right is returned.
If there are no <em>exprs</em>,
then a Just/Right of an unspecified value is returned.
If an <em>expr</em> does not evaluate to a Maybe/Either,
an error satisfying <code>error-object</code> is signaled.
<p><code>(maybe-or</code> <em>expr</em> ...<code>)</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;[syntax]<br>
<code>(either-or</code> <em>expr</em> ...<code>)</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;[syntax]</p>
The <em>exprs</em> are evaluated in order.
If an <em>expr</em> evaluates to a Just/Right, it is returned
without evaluating any more expressions.
Otherwise, the last Nothing/Left is returned.
If there are no <em>exprs</em>,
then Nothing / a Left of an unspecified value is returned.
If an <em>expr</em> does not evaluate to a Maybe/Either,
an error satisfying <code>error-object</code> is signaled.
<p><code>(maybe-let* (</code> <em>claw</em> ... <code>) .</code> <em>body</em><code>)</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;[syntax]<br>
<code>(either-let* (</code> <em>claw</em> ... <code>) .</code> <em>body</em><code>)</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;[syntax]</p>
<p>The Maybe/Either equivalent of <code>and-let*</code> from
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-2/srfi-2.html">SRFI 2</a>.
However, instead of testing whether a <em>claw</em> is true or false,
it tests whether it is Just/Right or Nothing/Left.
If a <em>claw</em> does not evaluate to a Maybe/Either,
an error satisfying <code>error-object</code> is signaled.
The same is true if a <em>claw</em> evaluates to a Just or Right
that wraps zero values or more than one value.</p>
<p>A <em>claw</em> is either a bound identifier,
or a list of length 1, in which case it is an expression,
or a list of length 2, in which case it is a variable and an expression.
In either case, the value of the <em>claw</em> is the value of the
bound variable or expression.
If the value of a <em>claw</em> is Nothing / a Left, the expression immediately
returns that value.
But if the value of a <em>claw</em> is a Just/Right,
then the variable (if any) is bound to its unwrapped value;
the scope of this binding is any remaining <em>claws</em>
and the <em>body</em>.
<p>If the values of all the <em>claws</em> are Just/Right, then
the <em>body</em> is evaluated
as if it were in a <code>(let () ...)</code>,
and its values are wrapped in a Just/Right and returned.</p>
<p><code>(maybe-let*-values (</code> <em>claw</em> ... <code>) .</code> <em>body</em><code>)</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;[syntax]<br>
<code>(either-let*-values (</code> <em>claw</em> ... <code>) .</code> <em>body</em><code>)</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;[syntax]<br>
<p>The same as <code>maybe/either-let*</code>,
except that the first element of a two-element claw
is a &lt;formals&gt; from <code>lambda</code>,
and the variables mentioned in it (if any)
are bound to the values that result from unpacking a Just/Right.
Note that a claw with a single variable in
<code>maybe/either-let*</code> is bound to
the sole value contained in the Just/Right,
whereas in <code>maybe/either-let*-values</code>,
it is bound to a list of all the values, just as
in a <code>lambda</code> expression,
a &lt;formals&gt; consisting of a single variable
is bound to a list of all the procedure arguments.</p>
<p><code>(either-guard </code> <em>pred-expr</em> <code>  . </code><em>body</em><code>)</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;[syntax]<br>
<p>The syntactic analogue of <code>exception-&gt;either</code>.
The <em>body</em> is evaluated,
and the values it produces are wrapped in a Right
and returned, unless an exception occurs.
If the condition object that is raised satisfies
the predicate that is the value of <em>pred-expr</em>,
the condition object is wrapped in a Left and returned; otherwise
the condition is reraised as if by <code>raise-continuable</code>.
</p>
<h3 id="trivalent-logic">Trivalent logic</h3>
<p>These procedures provide trivalent logic in the style of SQL on
Maybe objects containing a single value.  For the purposes of this section,
an object counts as false if it is Just <code>#f</code>,
true if it is Just anything else.
It is an error if any argument is not a Maybe.</p>
<p>Unlike <code>and</code> and <code>or</code>, <code>tri-and</code>
and <code>tri-or</code> are procedures and not syntax, because
determining their value requires that all the arguments be evaluated
in order to provide correct SQL-style semantics.  For example,
<code>(and #f (nothing))</code> will return <code>#f</code> immediately
without evaluating its second argument, but <code>(tri-and (just
#f) (nothing))</code> will return Nothing.</p>
<p><code>(tri-not</code> <em>maybe</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns Just <code>#t</code> if <em>maybe</em> is false, Just <code>#f</code> if <em>maybe</em> is true, and Nothing
if <em>maybe</em> is Nothing.</p>
<p><code>(tri=?</code> <em>maybe1 maybe2</em> ...<code>)</code></p>
<p>Similar to <code>boolean=?</code>, returning Just <code>#t</code> if all the <em>maybes</em> are true
or if all are false.  Otherwise, if any <em>maybe</em> is Nothing or any two <em>maybes</em>
have different (trivalent) truth values, returns Just <code>#f</code>.</p>
<p>Note: this function is not transitive and therefore is not an equivalence relation.</p>
<p><code>(tri-and</code> <em>maybe</em> ...<code>)</code></p>
<p>If all <em>maybes</em> are true, Just <code>#t</code> is returned.
If any <em>maybe</em> is false or Nothing, then
the first such <em>maybe</em> is returned.
If there are no arguments, Just <code>#t</code> is returned.</p>
<p><code>(tri-or</code> <em>maybe</em> ...<code>)</code></p>
<p>If all <em>maybes</em> are false, Just <code>#f</code> is returned.
If any <em>maybe</em> is true or Nothing, then
the first such <em>maybe</em> is returned.
If there are no arguments, Just <code>#f</code> is returned.</p>
<p><code>(tri-merge</code> <em>maybe</em> ...<code>)</code></p>
<p>If any <em>maybes</em> are true or false,
then the first such <em>maybe</em> is returned.
If all <em>maybes</em> are Nothing, then
Nothing is returned.
If there are no arguments, Nothing is returned.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p>Here is a variant of SRFI 1 <code>find</code> that returns a Maybe,
and so can be safely used to search for <code>#f</code> in a list,
just like any other value:<p>

<pre>
(define (maybe-find pred list)
  (cond
    ((null? list) (nothing))
    ((pred (car list)) (just (car list)))
    (else (maybe-find pred (cdr list)))))
</pre>

<p>The following examples show how <code>find</code>
and <code>maybe-find</code> differ in their results:</p>

<pre>
(define (atom? obj) (not (pair? obj)))
(define with-t '((1) #t (3) 4 5))
(define with-f '((1) #f (3) 4 5))
(define without '((1) (2) (3) (4) (5)))

(find atom? with-t) => #t
(find atom? with-f) => #f
(find atom? without) => #f

(maybe-find atom? with-t) => Just #t
(maybe-find atom? with-f) => Just #f
(maybe-find atom? without) => Nothing
</pre>
<p>And here is <code>head</code>, which is more general than <code>car</code>
because it lets the caller figure out what happens if its argument is not a pair
and can handle an argument that is either an actual pair or Just a pair.
<pre>
(define (head x)
  (cond
    ((pair? x) (just (car x)))
    ((and (just? x) (pair? (maybe-ref x))) (just (car (maybe-ref x))))
    (else (nothing))))
</pre>
<p>In other words, if the argument to <code>head</code> is a pair,
whether wrapped in a Just or not,
the result is the car of that pair wrapped in a Just;
in all other cases, the result is Nothing.
(There are simpler ways to do this using more advanced procedures.)</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>The sample implementation is found in <a href="https://github.com/scheme-requests-for-implementation/srfi-189/">the repository</a> of this SRFI.</p>
<h2 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>The Maybe and Either types and their procedures are based on Scala&#39;s Option
and Either types, though the name &quot;Maybe&quot; comes from Haskell.
(I think &quot;Maybe&quot; is catchier than &quot;Option&quot;, which ultimately comes from ML.)
The trivalent logic is loosely based on Chicken&#39;s <code>sql-null</code> egg.</p>
<p>Great thanks to Marc Nieper-Wißkirchen, whose insistence that Scheme's
multiple arguments and multiple values required an extension of this SRFI
to handle them correctly.
Thanks also to Shiro Kawai and the other participants on the SRFI 189 mailing list.</p>
