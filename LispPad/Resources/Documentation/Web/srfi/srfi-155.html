<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>
Scheme, like ML, is a programming language with strict evaluation
while others, like Haskell, use lazy evaluation.  Scheme, however,
possesses the primitives <code>delay</code> and <code>force</code>
that make it possible to express lazy algorithms.
</p>

<p>
Lazy evaluation does not go well in conjunction with imperative,
non-functional, side-effecting code.  It should, however, be
applicable in a purely functional setting.  This is the case for the
delayed evaluation model as described in the R7RS as long as no
dynamically bound variables, also known as parameter objects, are
present.  It is the purpose of this SRFI to rework the specification
in the R7RS so that lazy evaluation works with purely functional code
that makes use of dynamic environments or, more generally, the dynamic
extent.  This is done by remembering the dynamic extent in effect when
the <code>delay</code> expression is evaluated.
</p>

<p>
  Another perceived misfeature of the R7RS model of delayed evaluation
  is the apparent need of the <code>delay-force</code> special form to
  express iterative lazy algorithms.  It is shown that
  the <code>delay-force</code> special form is unneeded and that the
  implementation can (and should) handle iterative lazy algorithms
  without space leaks.
</p>

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<h2>Promises and the dynamic extent</h2>

<p>
In ticket #397 of
the Scheme Working Group 1, the question was raised how promises shall
interact with the dynamic extent, namely
whether <code>force</code> shall evaluate a promise in the dynamic
extent of the call to <code>force</code> which first requested its value.  An
opposing choice would be that <code>force</code> shall evaluate a
promise in the dynamic extent of the site where the promise was
created.
</p>

<p>
  The ticket was resolved apparently without any ballot or public
  discussion, and the former semantics was chosen for
  the <a href="http://r7rs.org">R7RS</a>.
  Accordingly, the description of <code>force</code> in the R7RS
  says: <q>Consequently, a delayed expression is evaluated using the
  parameter values and exception handler of the call
  to <code>force</code> which first requested its value.</q>
</p>

<p>It is the main thesis of this SRFI that the choice made by the
  editors of the R7RS
  was <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/scheme-reports-wg2/CQslZcWTXHM">the
  wrong one</a>, so this SRFI proposes a correction to
  the <code>(scheme lazy)</code> library in form of the <code>(scheme
  promise)</code> library.
</p>

<p>Lazy algorithms should work well together with purely functional
  code.  The use of parameter objects (for example functioning as
  implicit arguments to procedure calls), or more generally
  calls to <code>dynamic-wind</code> with a pair of <em>before</em> and <em>after</em>
  thunks that, abstractly, has a clear functional semantics is
  orthogonal to the question of whether code is purely functional or
  not.  However, with the semantics of <code>force</code> as currently
  in the R7RS, the order of evaluation of arguments in otherwise purely
  functional code suddenly matters:
</p>

<pre>
  (let ()
    (define x (make-parameter 1))
    (define p (delay (x)))
    (define (g p) (parameterize ((x 2)) (force p)))
    (+ (force p) (g p)))
</pre>

<p>
  Depending on the order of evaluation, this expression either
  evaluates to <code>2</code> or <code>4</code>.  Obviously, we don't
  expect that purely functional code exhibits such a behaviour.
  (Folks from the Haskell camp would have good reasons to shake their
  heads in astonishment.)  Reasoning about such code would be very hard.
</p>

<p>
  A more realistic example could be provided by a combination of an
  object system together with some lazy algorithm.  Such an object
  system may want to refer to the current instance
  by <code>this</code>.  One choice would be to explicitly
  thread <code>this</code> in the code (as Python does with
  explicitly mentioning <em>self</em> at each method definition) or
  to realize <code>this</code> as a syntax parameter (see
  <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-139/srfi-139.html">SRFI
  139</a>, a way C++ and Java chose.)  A third way, more along
  Python's semantics but without explicitly
  mentioning <code>this</code> (or <em>self</em>) at every method
  definition site would be to define <code>this</code> as a parameter
  object (in the sense of the R7RS), which is parameterized at each
  call site of a method.  Now, if the lazy algorithm
  references <code>this</code>, most certainly the parameter value
  of <code>this</code> when initially referred to and not when firstly
  forced is the correct one.
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately, the semantics of R7RS would get it wrong.  Does this
  sound familiar?  Of course!  ECMAScript's functions suffer from the
  same problem, namely that the value of <code>this</code> is not remembered
  as part of the closure.  (In ECMAScript 2015 this problem was
  remedied in form of &ldquo;arrow functions&rdquo;.)
</p>

<p>
  However, there might be legitimate reasons to access the dynamic extent at the
  site of the first invocation to <code>force</code>, for example for
  debugging purposes.  Therefore, this SRFI defines an optional
  procedure <code>forcing-extent</code>, which returns the dynamic extent (in the sense
  of <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-154/srfi-154.html">SRFI
    154</a>) of the most recent call to <code>force</code>.
  The procedure is optional because its presence complicates the
  semantic model of lazy evaluation again.
  Using <code>(forcing-extent)</code> makes code as the following possible:
</p>

<pre>
  (import (scheme base)
          (scheme write)
          (srfi 154)
          (srfi 155))
  (define current-logger (make-parameter #f))
  (define (log msg) ((current-logger) msg))
  (define (default-logger msg)
    (display msg (current-error-port))
    (newline (current-error-port)))
  (define-syntax logged-delay
    (syntax-rules ()
      ((delay/logged expression)
       (delay (begin (with-dynamic-environment (forcing-environment)
                      (lambda ()
                        (log "promised value calculated just now")))
                     expression)))))
  (let ((p (delay 1)))
    (parameterize ((current-logger default-logger))
      (display "The answer is: ")
      (display (+ (force p) 41))
      (newline)))
</pre>

<p>In particular, it is possible to implement the semantic model of
  the R7RS in terms of the model of this SRFI when the
  procedure <code>forcing-environment</code> is included.
</p>

<h2>Iterative lazy algorithms</h2>

<p>
The R5RS and the R7RS make no guarantee that expressing iterative lazy
algorithms just with <code>delay</code> and <code>force</code> will
run in bounded space.  Instead, they provide a special
form <code>delay-force</code> such that <code>(delay-force
&lt;expression&gt;)</code> is equivalent to <code>(delay (force
&lt;expression&gt;))</code> except that forcing the resulting promise
guarantees to evaluate <code>(force &lt;expression&gt;)</code> in tail
position.  The R7RS gives an example in form of
the <code>stream-filter</code> procedure that makes use of
the <code>delay-force</code> form.
</p>

<p>
From a user's perspective, the need for this third primitive is not
optimal, and one may think that a Scheme system properly supporting
delayed evaluation should handle <code>(delay (force
&lt;expression&gt;))</code> as gracefully as it does handle calls in
tail position (as described in section 3.5 of the R7RS).
</p>

<p>
As an improvement, it was suggested by Alex Shinn on the mailing list
of this SRFI that <code>delay</code> should be redefined along
the following lines:
</p>

<pre>
  (define-syntax delay
    (syntax-rules (force)
      ((delay (force expression))
       (delay-force expression)
      ((delay expression)
       ...)))</pre>

<p>
  With this definition, during expansion of <code>delay</code> the system
  statically detects whether the expression to be delayed is of the
  form <code>(force &lt;expression&gt;)</code>. This means
  that <code>delay-force</code> does not have to be exposed anymore
  and that a Scheme user can write <code>(delay (force
  &lt;expression&gt;))</code> instead of <code>(delay-force
  &lt;expression&gt;)</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Besides probably being more user-friendly, this redefinition of <code>delay</code>
  makes the delayed evaluation model also more composable, hence more
  powerful:  Consider, for example, the following code (making use of
  <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-111/srfi-111.html">SRFI 111:
  Boxes</a>):
</p>

<pre>
  (define-syntax lazy-box
    (syntax-rules ()
      ((lazy-box expression)
       (box (delay expression)))))

  (define-syntax lazy-unbox
    (syntax-rules ()
      ((lazy-unbox box)
       (force (unbox box)))))</pre>

<p>
The lazy boxes defined by these two keywords wrap a promise in a box.
The pair of <code>lazy-box</code> and <code>lazy-unbox</code> provides
the same primitives for lazy boxes as do <code>delay</code>
and <code>force</code> for non-boxed promises.  Using the suggested
semantics that <code>(delay (force &lt;expression&gt;))</code> is
equivalent to <code>(delay-force &lt;expression&gt;)</code>, the
composition <code>(lazy-box (lazy-unbox &lt;expression&gt;))</code>
reduces correctly and makes expressing iterative lazy algorithms with
lazy boxes possible.
</p>

<p>
In order to make this work, <code>lazy-unbox</code> has to be defined as
syntax and not as a procedure.  Had we defined <code>lazy-unbox</code>
as a procedure, the call to <code>force</code> in tail position would
have remained hidden from the syntax expander.
</p>

<p>
  While the automatic syntactic reduction of <code>(delay (force
    &lt;expression&gt;))</code> to <code>(delay-force
    &lt;expression&gt;)</code> is, as this example shows, better than
  exposing <code>delay-force</code> directly, this necessity of having to
  define <code>lazy-unbox</code> as syntax also shows that the proposed
  semantics is still a suboptimal choice.  Furthermore, the model
  breaks down in more complicated cases:
</p>

<pre>
  (delay (if flag? (force x) (force y)))</pre>

<p>Forcing the result of this expression won't guarantee
  that <code>(force x)</code> or <code>(force y)</code> is evaluated
  in a tail position although both calls appear in tail context inside
  the <code>delay</code> form.
</p>

<p>
So again, from a user's perspective, this handling of <code>(delay
(force &lt;expression&gt;))</code> is still not as graceful as it
should be. The problem is that the previous solution is based on
detecting the presence of <code>force</code> syntactically.
</p>

<p>Instead, what is needed is the following: If
  evaluating <code>&lt;expression&gt;</code> results in a tail call of
  the form <code>(force <em>promise</em>)</code>, forcing the result
  of <code>(delay &lt;expression&gt;)</code> will also result in a
  tail call to <code>(force <em>promise</em>)</code>.
</p>

<p>It is not possible to achieve this syntactically.  It is, however,
  possible to implement this requirement using the continuation marks
  of <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-157/srfi-157.html">SRFI
    157</a>, which is demonstrated by the sample implementation
  accompanying this SRFI.
</p>

<h1>Specification</h1>

<p>We use the term <em>dynamic extent</em> for reified dynamic extents
  as in <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-154/srfi-154.html">SRFI
  154</a>.
</p>

<p>The mandatory identifiers defined by this specification are
exported by the library <code>(srfi 155)</code>.  The optional
identifiers are exported by the library <code>(srfi 155
reflection)</code>.  If an implementation provides the
library <code>(srfi 155 reflection)</code>, it has to provide all
optional identifiers.
</p>

<p>
  The author of this SRFI recommends that the interface described in
  this SRFI be made available under the namespace <code>(scheme
  promise)</code> (and <code>(scheme promise reflection)</code>) in
  future revisions of the Scheme programming language that build upon
  the R7RS.  When this happens, <code>(scheme lazy)</code> might
  become deprecated and remain solely for backward-compatibility with
  the R7RS.  It is further recommended that <code>(scheme
  stream)</code> of the R7RS-large uses the same semantics with
  respect to the dynamic extent as this SRFI.
</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p><code>(delay &lt;expression&gt;)</code></p>

<p>
  <code>(delay &lt;expression&gt;)</code> returns an object called
  a <em>promise</em> which at some point in the future can be asked
  (by the <code>force</code> procedure) to
  evaluate <code>&lt;expression&gt;</code> in the dynamic extent
  in effect when the <code>delay</code> expression was evaluated, and
  deliver the resulting value.  The effect
  of <code>&lt;expression&gt;</code> returning multiple values is
  unspecified.
</p>

<p>
  If forcing the result of <code>(delay &lt;expression&gt;)</code>
  results in a tail call of the form <code>(force
    <em>promise</em>)</code>,  forcing of the result is required to
  also result in a tail call to <code>(force <em>promise</em>)</code>.
</p>

<p><i>Rationale:</i> This makes iterative lazy algorithms without
  space leaks possible; see
  also <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-45/srfi-45.html">SRFI
  45</a>.
</p>

<p><code>(delay-force &lt;expression&gt;)</code></p>

<p>
  Equivalent to <code>(delay (force &lt;expression&gt;))</code>.  This
  form is provided only for backward compatibility, and its use is
  deprecated.
</p>

<h2>Procedures</h2>

<p><code>(force <em>promise</em>)</code></p>

<p>The <code>force</code> procedure forces the value of
  a <em>promise</em> created
  by <code>delay</code>, <code>delay-force</code>,
  or <code>make-promise</code>.  If no value has been computed for the
  promise, the value is computed in the dynamic extent in
  effect when the <code>delay</code>, <code>delay-force</code>,
  or <code>make-promise</code> expression was evaluated, and
  returned.  The value of the promise must be cached (or
  &ldquo;memoized&rdquo;) so that if it is forced a second time, the
  previously computed value is returned.  If <em>promise</em> is not a
  promise, it may be returned unchanged.
</p>

<p><code>(promise? <em>obj</em>)</code></p>

<p>The <code>promise?</code> procedure returns <code>#t</code> if its argument
  is a promise, and <code>#f</code> otherwise.  Note that promises are
  not necessarily disjoint from other Scheme types such as procedures.
</p>

<p><code>(make-promise <em>obj</em>)</code></p>

<p>The <code>make-promise</code> procedure returns a promise which,
  when forced, will return <em>obj</em>.  It is similar
  to <code>delay</code>, but does not delay its argument; it is a
  procedure rather than syntax.  If <code>obj</code> is already a
  promise, it is returned.
</p>

<h3>Optional procedures</h3>

<p><code>(forcing-extent)</code></p>

<p>When the value of a promise <code>(delay &lt;expression&gt;)</code>
  is asked for the first time and <code>&lt;expression&gt;</code> is
  evaluated, an invocation of <code>(forcing-extent)</code> in the
  dynamic extent of that evaluation returns the dynamic extent (as
  defined
  by <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-154/srfi-154.html">SRFI
  154</a>) of the call to <code>force</code> that initially forced the
  promise.  If forcing a promise yields a chain of <code>delay</code>
  and <code>force</code>, the dynamic extent returned
  by <code>(forcing-extent)</code> is the dynamic extent of the
  outermost call to <code>force</code> in this chain.  It is an error
  to invoke <code>forcing-environment</code> outside the dynamic
  extent of <code>&lt;expression&gt;</code>.
</p>

<p><code>(dynamic-environment? <em>obj</em>)</code></p>

<p>Type predicate for dynamic extent as exported by <code>(srfi 154)</code>.</p>

<h1>Implementation</h1>

<p>The provided <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-155/srfi-155.tgz">sample implementation</a> for
  an R7RS system builds upon the sample implementation
  of <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-154/srfi-154.html">SRFI
    154</a>.
</p>

<p>
  It is a faithful implementation if the presence of the
  library <code>(srfi 157)</code>
  of <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-157/srfi-157.html">SRFI
    157: Continuation marks</a> is detected on the host system.
</p>

<p>
  Otherwise, the requirement that <code>(force (delay
    &lt;expression&gt;))</code> results in a tail call to <code>(force
    <em>promise</em>)</code> whenever
  evaluating <code>&lt;expression&gt;</code> results in a tail call
  to <code>(force <em>promise</em>)</code> is only met
  when <code>&lt;expression&gt;</code> expands into the
  form <code>(force <em>promise</em>)</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Their is also an interface to the implementation as
  a <a href="srfi/155.rkt">Racket module</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The sample implementation provides the optional procedures.
</p>

<p>The portable R7RS implementation can cause unwanted space leaks
  because it does not use shallow keys for continuation marks (see the
  addendum to SRFI 157 in SRFI 154).  A full implementation of this
  specification without any space leaks is provided in the form of a
  meta-circular interpreter written in R7RS dubbed <a href="https://gitlab.com/nieper/inferior-scheme/">Inferior Scheme</a>,
  which is a REPL for the Scheme IEEE 1178-1990 standard. Outside of
  the standard syntax and procedures, Inferior Scheme provides the
  syntax and the procedures of SRFIs 154, 155, and 157,
  the <code>load</code> procedure of the
  R4RS, <code>dynamic-wind</code> of R5RS,
  and <code>parameterize</code> and <code>make-parameter</code> of
  R7RS.
