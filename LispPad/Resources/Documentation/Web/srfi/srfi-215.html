    <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

    <p>
      This SRFI specifies a central log exchange for Scheme that
      connects log producers with log consumers. It allows multiple
      logging systems to interoperate and co-exist in the same
      program. Library code can produce log messages without knowledge
      of which log system is actually used. Simple applications can
      easily get logs on standard output, while more advanced
      applications can send them to a full logging system.
    </p>

    <h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

    <p>
      Logging is important in many systems, such as large
      Internet-connected services, where problems are often only
      evident after the fact. A system designed with logging allows
      evidence to be gathered and analyzed after an incident. Logs are
      also used to predict imminent problems and alert operators so
      that they can take action before an incident occurs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Scheme lacks a standard logging system. There are some
      precedents in the Scheme ecosystem, such
      as <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/logging.html">Racket's
        logging system</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/rotty/spells/blob/master/spells/logging.sls">Andreas
        Rottmann's spells package</a>
      and
      <a href="https://github.com/ashinn/chibi-scheme/blob/master/lib/chibi/log.scm">Chibi
        Scheme's log library</a>.
      These are examples of high-level logging systems which are intended
      to be used directly by code that needs to generate log messages.
      Another precedent is
      <a href="https://www.s48.org/1.9.2/manual/manual-Z-H-10.html#node_sec_9.10">Scheme48's
        access to the syslog facility</a>,
      which is a low-level logging system that specifically sends logs
      to the syslog service.
    </p>

    <p>
      The logging system in this SRFI is designed to be inserted
      in between a high-level and a low-level logging system. The main
      concern is to have a central point that all Scheme code can use
      to send log messages, and which an application can hook up to
      whichever log systems it uses. Library code can also choose to
      use another log system and application developers would then
      hook up those log systems to the one specified here. By
      providing a well-known central exchange point through which all
      log messages are passed, it becomes possible to work generally
      with log messages throughout the whole application, regardless
      of which frameworks end up being used to generate and consume
      log messages.
    </p>

    <p>
      The API exported by this SRFI consists of one procedure, two
      parameters and eight constants.
      The <code>send-log</code> procedure is a convenient procedure
      for constructing log messages. It can be used in code that just
      needs to produce log messages and that does not need any
      advanced log system features.
      The <code>current-log-fields</code> parameter lets an
      application set application-wide log fields, such as the syslog
      facility, thread-local fields such as a subsystem name, or fields
      that are local to just some smaller context such as a test suite.
      The <code>current-log-callback</code> parameter is the actual
      central point for exchanging log messages. Its definition as a
      parameter object is analogous to the definition
      of <code>current-output-port</code> (etc.) and allows some
      advanced features to be built, such as capture of log messages
      in test runners and custom filtering steps.
    </p>

    <p>
      This SRFI bases some design elements on the syslog protocol
      (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5424.html">RFC 5424</a>)
      and others on the systemd journal. These are both suited as
      targets for the logs produced by users of this SRFI, but nothing
      in this SRFI requires the use of them. It is expected that
      implementers and other users of this SRFI will construct and
      adapt log messages to be appropriate for the systems they are
      creating.
    </p>

    <h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>

    <h3 id="api">API</h3>

    <p>
      <b>Procedure:</b> <code>(send-log <i>severity</i> <i>message</i> [<i>key</i> <i>value</i>] …)</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      Constructs a log message that contains the arguments and the
      current log fields. The resulting log message is passed as
      an argument to the current log callback.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <i>severity</i> is one of the constants in the table below.
      Its numeric value is added to the log message with the key
      <code>SEVERITY</code>.
    </p>

    <table>
      <caption>Log message severities</caption>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Constant</th>
          <th>Numeric</th>
          <th>Meaning</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>EMERGENCY</td> <td>0</td> <td>system is unusable</td></tr>
        <tr><td>ALERT</td>     <td>1</td> <td>action must be taken immediately</td></tr>
        <tr><td>CRITICAL</td>  <td>2</td> <td>critical conditions</td></tr>
        <tr><td>ERROR</td>     <td>3</td> <td>error conditions</td></tr>
        <tr><td>WARNING</td>   <td>4</td> <td>warning conditions</td></tr>
        <tr><td>NOTICE</td>    <td>5</td> <td>normal but significant condition</td></tr>
        <tr><td>INFO</td>      <td>6</td> <td>informational messages</td></tr>
        <tr><td>DEBUG</td>     <td>7</td> <td>debug-level messages</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      The optional arguments are grouped into pairs of <i>key</i>s
      and <i>value</i>s and are added to the log message, as in an
      association list. The value is first converted as described
      below. The order in which fields appear in the log message is
      unspecified.
    </p>

    <p>
      An error is signaled if an odd number of arguments is passed. An
      error is signaled if one of the <i>key</i>s is not a symbol.
      Implementations MAY support other types of keys, e.g. keyword
      arguments, but they MUST be converted to symbols before being
      added to the log message.
    </p>

    <p>
      To simplify the handling of values in log callbacks that need
      to serialize values, every <i>value</i> satisfies at least one
      of the type predicates listed under <a href="#keys">Log messages</a>.
      All other objects are converted to strings as if they
      had been printed to a string output port by the
      <code>write</code> procedure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Implementations MAY convert objects in some other way, but the
      resulting value in the log message MUST satisfy one of the
      predicates. A value MAY be converted into an arbitrary number of
      fields. Implementations MAY append additional fields to the
      message, such as internal process identifiers, timestamps and
      other useful context. But it is expected that a high-level
      logging system will take care of these aspects.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is an error to mutate the <i>message</i> or one of
      the <i>value</i>s after calling this procedure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Example: <pre>
(send-log 'INFO (string-append "User " username " logged in")
          'USERNAME username 'REMOTE_IP remote-ip)
</pre>

    <p>
      <b>Parameter:</b> <code>current-log-fields</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      This parameter contains a list of additional keys and values
      that are automatically appended to the fields passed
      to <code>send-log</code>. The effect is as if that procedure was
      always invoked as <code>(apply send-log severity message [key
      value] ... (current-log-fields))</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The default value for this parameter is <code>()</code>, the
      empty list. Implementations MAY use another default value.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is an error to mutate any part of the list.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Parameter:</b> <code>current-log-callback</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      This parameter is bound to the current <dfn>log callback</dfn>,
      which is a procedure that takes a log message as its single
      argument. Log messages are passed as association lists.
    </p>

    <p>
      The default value for this parameter is a procedure that is
      meant to handle log messages that are generated before the
      application changes the callback. This default procedure buffers
      an implementation-defined number of messages. When the callback
      is changed, the new callback receives each message that had been
      buffered. The buffer is then cleared, to handle the case where
      the default callback is restored by <code>parameterize</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is an error to call a log callback with anything except a
      proper association list that contains the
      keys <code>SEVERITY</code> and <code>MESSAGE</code> as described
      below.
    </p>

    <p>
      Log callbacks MAY discard any field and MAY discard any message.
      Log callbacks MUST ensure that all messages from the same thread
      of control arrive in the same order in which they were passed to the
      callback.
    </p>

    <p>
      This parameter is meant to be controlled by the application.
      Libraries MUST NOT change this parameter except as requested by
      the application.
    </p>

    <h3 id="keys">Log messages</h3>

    <p>
      Log messages are association lists that are normally expected to
      be constructed by <code>send-log</code>, but they can also be
      passed directly to the log callback with some care.
      All keys in a log message MUST be symbols and all values MUST satisfy
      at least one of
      <code>string?</code>,
      <code>bytevector?</code>,
      <code>exact-integer?</code>,
      <code>error-object?</code> (R7RS) or
      <code>condition?</code> (R6RS).
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is a simple example message. The log message
      <code>((MESSAGE . "Test message") (SEVERITY . 7))</code>
      contains the message "Test message" and its severity
      is DEBUG.
    </p>

    <p>
      Applications and library developers are free to design their own
      log message keys. For the sake of interoperability it is
      desirable to standardize the names of certain keys, shown in the
      table below.
    </p>

    <table>
      <caption>Log message keys</caption>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Symbol</th>
          <th>Mandatory</th>
          <th>Meaning</th>
          <th>Reference</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>SEVERITY<sup>‡</sup></td>   <td>yes</td> <td>severity as an exact integer in [0,7]</td>   <td>RFC 5424, 6.2.1</td></tr>

        <tr><td>MESSAGE_ID</td>             <td>no</td>  <td>128-bit message identifier</td>    <td>systemd.journal-fields(7)</td></tr>

        <tr>

        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      <sup>‡</sup> = In the systemd journal this field is confusingly
      called PRIORITY.<br>
      <sup>✻</sup> = In the systemd journal these fields are part of
      the SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER field, mirroring the
      obsolete <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3164">RFC
      3164</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      An up-to-date list of log message keys will be found in the
      <a href="https://registry.scheme.org/">Scheme registry</a>.
      Additions to the list can be made directly in the registry
      without updating this SRFI.
    </p>

    <h3 id="parameters">Parameter implementation</h3>

    <p>
      Implementations are free to use any reasonable implementation of
      parameter objects, such as <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-39/">SRFI 39</a>, but care should be taken
      that <code>parameterize</code> does not affect the behavior of
      other threads of control. If an implementation provides R7RS (or
      a future standard/report with parameters) then it SHOULD use
      parameters that are compatible with the ones in the base library.
    </p>

    <h2 id="library-name">Library name</h2>

    <p>
      Systems that
      implement <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-97/">SRFI
      97</a> should make this library available under the names
      <code>(srfi :215)</code> and <code>(srfi :215 logging)</code>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

    <p>
      A sample implementation is provided as an R7RS library. It has
      no dependencies beyond R7RS Small. A test suite is also
      provided.
    </p>

    <a href="srfi-215-sample.sld">Source for the sample implementation.</a>

    <p>
      Here is an example of a simple log callback. When a program
      using this callback runs as a systemd unit, the output will be
      translated to journal entries marked with severities. A more
      complete integration with the systemd journal would also pass
      along the fields given to <code>send-log</code> through the
      appropriate API.
    </p>

<pre>
(current-log-callback
 (lambda (msg)
   (let ((p (current-error-port)))
     (display "&lt;" p)
     (display (cdr (assq 'SEVERITY msg)) p)
     (display "&gt;" p)
     (display (cdr (assq 'MESSAGE msg)) p)
     (newline p))))

(send-log DEBUG "Log callback configured")
</pre>
