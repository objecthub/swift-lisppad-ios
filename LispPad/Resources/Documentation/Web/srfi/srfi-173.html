    <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

    <p>This library describes a mechanism known as hooks. Hooks are a
    certain kind of extension point in a program that allows
    interleaving the execution of arbitrary code with the execution
    of the program without introducing any coupling between the
    two.</p>

    <h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

    <p>The use of hooks is pervasive in GNU Emacs and many other
    programs that offer some “plugin” mechanism that is built on top
    a facility similar to what this library offers.</p>

    <p>While building programs, there is a need to offer extension
    points to allow the user to extend and customize the execution of
    the program in way that avoids coupling. This library wants to
    help with that.</p>

    <h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>

    <p>This specification describes one disjoint type called
    <code>hook</code>.</p>

    <h3 id="make-hook-arity"><code>(make-hook arity)</code></h3>

    <p>Create a <code>hook</code> object for storing procedures of
    <code>ARITY</code>. The returned value is a <code>hook</code>
    object.</p>

    <h3 id="hook-obj"><code>(hook? obj)</code></h3>

    <p>Return <code>#t</code> if <code>obj</code> is a hook.
    Otherwise, it returns <code>#f</code>.</p>

    <h3 id="hook-add-hook-proc"><code>(hook-add! hook proc)</code></h3>

    <p>Add the procedure <code>PROC</code> to the <code>HOOK</code>
    object. The return value is not specified. An implementation may
    check that the arity of <code>PROC</code> is equal to the arity
    of the <code>HOOK</code>.</p>

    <h3 id="hook-delete-hook-proc"><code>(hook-delete! hook proc)</code></h3>

    <p>Delete the procedure <code>PROC</code> from the
    <code>HOOK</code> object. The return value is not specified.</p>

    <h3 id="hook-reset-hook"><code>(hook-reset! hook)</code></h3>

    <p>Remove all procedures from the <code>HOOK</code> object. The
    return value is not specified.</p>

    <h3 id="hook-list-hook"><code>(hook-&gt;list hook)</code></h3>

    <p>Convert the list of procedures of <code>HOOK</code> object to
    a list.</p>

    <h3 id="hook-run-hook-.-args"><code>(hook-run hook . args)</code></h3>

    <p>Apply all procedures from <code>HOOK</code> to the arguments
    <code>ARGS</code>. The order of the procedure application is not
    specified. The return value is not specified. The length of
    <code>ARGS</code> must be equal to the arity of the
    <code>HOOK</code> object.</p>

    <h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

    <p>A portable <a href= "https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-173/srfi-173.tgz">sample
      implementation is provided.</a></p>
