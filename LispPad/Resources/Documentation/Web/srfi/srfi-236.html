  <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

  <p>This SRFI defines the <code>independently</code> syntax, which can be
  used to combine side effects into one expression without
  specifying their relative order.</p>

  <h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

  <p>The purpose of the <code>begin</code> expression type in the
    existing Scheme standards is two-fold.  Firstly, it can be used to
    combine several expressions into one expression.  Secondly, it is
    used to sequence the side effects of these expressions by
    specifying an evaluation order.</p>

  <p>In many use cases, only the first property is needed while any
    specific sequence order would be arbitrary.  Thus, many Scheme
    programs written with <code>begin</code> overspecify the
    underlying algorithm.  As Scheme is a language to write down
    algorithms as much as it is a practical programming language,
    this SRFI introduces the <code>independently</code> syntax, which is
    similar to <code>begin</code> but without any specific
    evaluation order (and thus no return value(s)).</p>

  <p>The practical side of the <code>independently</code> syntax is that
    it allows a compiler to reorder expressions freely and that it
    helps documenting code.  If expressions appear inside
    an <code>independently</code> form, the programmer expresses the fact
    that the relative order of these expressions does not matter.
    This can make imperatively-written programs easier to
    understand.</p>

  <p>As the result of an <code>independently</code> expression is
    unspecified, an <code>independently</code> expression, contrary to
    a <code>begin</code> expression, need not contain any
    expression.  This can make an <code>independently</code> expression
    useful for macro writers.</p>

  <h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>

  <h3>Example</h3>

  <p>The following procedure could have been written
    with <code>begin</code> instead of <code>independently</code> but it
    would have been an overspecification of the underlying
    algorithmic content.</p>

  <pre>(define set-car+cdr!
(lambda (p x y)
  (assert (pair? p))
  (independently
    (set-car! p x)
    (set-cdr! p y))))</pre>

  <h3>Syntax</h3>

  <p><code>(independently &langle;expression&rangle; &hellip;)</code></p>

  <p>Evaluates the &langle;expressions&rangle;s in an unspecified
    order and discards their return values.  The result of
    the <code>independently</code> expression is unspecified.</p>

  <p><i>Note:</i> Although the order of evaluation is otherwise
    unspecified, the effect of any concurrent evaluation of the
    &langle;expressions&rangle; is constrained to be consistent with
    some sequential order of evaluation. The order of evaluation may
    be chosen differently for each evaluation of
    the <code>independently</code> form.</p>

  <h3>Library name</h3>

  <p>The <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-97/">SRFI 97</a>-conformant
    library name of this SRFI is <code>(srfi :236 independently)</code>.</p>

  <h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

  <p>The following is an R<sup>6</sup>RS implementation.</p>

  <pre>(library (srfi :236 independently)
(export independently)
(import (rnrs))
(define-syntax independently
  (lambda (stx)
    (syntax-case stx ()
      [(_ expr ...)
       (with-syntax ([(tmp ...) (generate-temporaries #'(expr ...))])
         #'(let ([tmp (begin expr #f)] ...) (values)))]
      [_ (syntax-violation 'independently "invalid syntax" stx)]))))</pre>

  <p>And here is an R<sup>7</sup>RS (small) implementation.</p>

  <pre>(define-library (srfi 236)
(export independently)
(import (scheme base))
(begin
  (define-syntax independently
    (syntax-rules ()
((independently expr ...)
 (independently-aux (expr ...)))))
  (define-syntax independently-aux
    (syntax-rules ()
((independently-aux () (expr tmp) ...)
 (let ((tmp (begin expr #f)) ...) (values)))
((independently-aux (expr . exprs) . binds)
 (independently-aux exprs (expr tmp) . binds))))))</pre>

  <h2 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2>

  <p>Thanks go to the members of the Scheme Working Group 2 for
    discussing the idea of the <code>independently</code> expression
    with me.  The name <code>independently</code> was suggested by
    Lassi Kortela.  Special thanks to Göran Weinholt, who tested the
    previous sample implementation on his Loko compiler and on Chez
    Scheme.</p>
