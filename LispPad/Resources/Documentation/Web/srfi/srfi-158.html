<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>This SRFI defines utility procedures that create, transform, and consume generators.
A generator is simply a procedure with no arguments that works
as a source of values.  Every time it is called,
it yields a value.  Generators may be finite or infinite; a finite
generator returns an end-of-file object to indicate that it is exhausted.
For example, <code>read-char</code>, <code>read-line</code>,
and <code>read</code> are generators that
generate characters, lines, and objects from the current input port.
Generators provide lightweight laziness.
</p>

<p>This SRFI also defines procedures that return accumulators.
An accumulator is the inverse of a generator:  it is a procedure of one argument
that works as a sink of values.
</p>

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<p>The main purpose of generators is high performance.  Although
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-41/srfi-41.html">SRFI 41</a>
streams can do everything generators can do and more,
SRFI 41 uses lazy pairs that require making a thunk for every item.
Generators can generate items without consing, so they are
very lightweight and are useful for implementing simple
on-demand calculations.</p>

<p>Existing examples of generators are readers from the current input port 
and <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-27/srfi-27.html">SRFI 27</a>
random numbers.
If Scheme had streams as one of its built-in
abstractions, these would have been naturally represented by
lazy streams.  But Scheme usually does not expose this
kind of API using lazy streams.  Generator-like interfaces are
common, so it seems worthwhile to have some common idioms
extracted into a library.</p>

<p>Calling a generator is a
side-effecting construct; you can't safely backtrack, for example,
as you can with streams.
Persistent lazy sequences based on generators and ordinary Scheme pairs
(which are heavier weight than generators, but lighter weight
than lazy pairs) are the subject of SRFI 127.
Of course the efficiency of streams depends on the implementation.
Some implementations may have have super-light thunk creation.  But in most,
thunk creation is probably slower than simple consing.</p>

<p>
An accumulator is the inverse of a generator:  it is a procedure of one argument
that works as a sink of a series of values.
When an accumulator is called on an object that is not an end-of-file object, the
object is added to the accumulator's state, and the accumulator returns an unspecified value.
How the object is integrated into the state depends on how
accumulator was constructed.
When an accumulator is called on an end-of-file object, the accumulator returns its state.
It is an error to call an accumulator on anything but an end-of-file object after that.
</p>

<p>The generators and accumulators of this SRFI don't belong to a disjoint type.
They are just procedures that conform to a calling convention, 
so you can construct a generator or accumulator with <code>lambda</code>.  The constructors
of this SRFI are provided for convenience.
Any procedure that can be called with no arguments can serve as a
generator.
Likewise, any procedure that can be called with one argument can serve as an accumulator.
</p>

<p>Note that neither generators nor accumulators can be assumed to be
thread-safe.</p>

<p>Using an end-of-file object to indicate that there is no more input
makes it impossible to include such an object in the stream of generated or accumulated values.
However, it is compatible with the existing design of input ports,
and it makes for
more compact code than returning a user-specified termination object (as in Common Lisp)
or returning multiple values.
(Note that some generators are infinite in length, and never return an end-of-file object.)
</p>

<p> The combination of <code>make-for-each-generator</code> and
<code>generator-unfold</code> makes it possible to convert any
collection that has a for-each procedure into any collection that has
an unfold constructor.  This generalizes such conversion procedures as
<code>list-&gt;vector</code> and <code>string-&gt;list</code>.</p>

<p>These procedures are drawn from the Gauche core and the Gauche module
<a href="http://practical-scheme.net/gauche/man/gauche-refe/Generators.html"><code>gauche.generator</code></a>
with some renaming to make them more systematic, and with a few additions
from the Python library
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html"><code>itertools</code></a>.
Consequently, Shiro Kawai,
the author of Gauche and its specifications, is listed as first author
of this SRFI.  John Cowan served as editor and shepherd.  Thomas Gilray
provided the sample implementation and a valuable critique of the SRFI.
Special acknowledgements to Kragen Javier Sitaker for his extensive review.</p>

This SRFI differs from SRFI 121 by restoring the generator constructor
<code>circular-generator</code> and the generator operations 
<code>gflatten</code>, <code>ggroup</code>, <code>gmerge</code>,
<code>gmap</code>,
<code>gstate-filter</code>, and <code>generator-map->list</code>
from <code>gauche.generator</code>.
It also adds the definition of accumulators and and some accumulator constructors.

<h1>Specification</h1>

<p>Generators can be divided into two classes, finite and infinite.  Both kinds of generators can be invoked an indefinite number of times.  After a finite generator has generated all its values, it will return an end-of-file object for all subsequent calls.
A generator is said to be <i>exhausted</i> if calling it will return an end-of-file object.
By definition, infinite generators can never be exhausted.</p>

<p>A generator is said to be in an <i>undefined state</i> if it
cannot be determined exactly how many values it has generated.
This arises because it is impossible to tell by inspecting a
generator whether it is exhausted.  For example,
<code>(generator-fold + 0 (generator 1 2 3) (generator 1 2))</code>
will compute 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6, at which time the second
generator will be exhausted.  If the first generator is invoked,
however, it may return either 3 or an end-of-file object,
depending on whether the implementation of <code>generator-fold</code>
has invoked it.
Therefore, the first generator is said to be in an undefined state.

<p>After passing an end-of-file object to an accumulator, it is an
error to pass anything but another end-of-file object.  However,
end-of-file objects may be passed repeatedly, and always produce
the same result.</p>

<h2 class="subsection">Generator constructors</h2>

<p>The result of a generator constructor is just a procedure,
so printing it doesn't show much.  In the examples in this section
we use <code>generator-&gt;list</code> to convert the generator to a list.
</p>
<p>These procedures have names ending with <code>generator</code>.</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>generator</code><i> arg …</i></dt>
<dd><p>The simplest finite generator.  Generates each of its arguments in turn.
When no arguments are provided, it returns an empty generator that generates no values.
</p></dd></dl>
<dl>
<dt><code>circular-generator</code><i> arg<sub>1</sub> arg<sub>2</sub> …</i></dt>
<dd><p>The simplest infinite generator.  Generates each of its arguments in turn,
then generates them again in turn, and so on forever.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><code>make-iota-generator</code><i> count [ start  [ step ] ]</i></dt>
<dd><p>Creates a finite generator of a sequence of <var>count</var>
numbers.  The sequence begins with <var>start</var> (which defaults to 0)
and increases by <var>step</var> (which defaults to 1).
If both <var>start</var> and <var>step</var> are exact, it generates
exact numbers; otherwise it generates inexact numbers.  The exactness
of <var>count</var> doesn't affect the exactness of the results.

<dl>
<dt><code>make-range-generator</code><i> start [ end  [ step ] ]</i></dt>
<dd><p>Creates a generator of a sequence of
numbers.  The sequence begins with <var>start</var>,
increases by <var>step</var> (default 1),
and continues while the number is less than <var>end</var>,
or forever if <var>end</var> is omitted.
If both <var>start</var> and <var>step</var> are exact, it generates
exact numbers; otherwise it generates inexact numbers.  The exactness
of <var>end</var> doesn't affect the exactness of the results.

<dt><code>make-coroutine-generator</code><i> proc</i></dt>
<dd><p>Creates a generator from a coroutine.
</p>
<p>The <var>proc</var> argument is a procedure that takes one argument, <var>yield</var>.  When
called, <code>make-coroutine-generator</code> immediately returns
a generator <var>g</var>.  When <var>g</var> is called, <var>proc</var> runs
until it calls <var>yield</var>.  Calling <var>yield</var> causes
the execution of <var>proc</var> to be suspended, and <var>g</var> returns the value passed

</p>
<p>Whether this generator is finite or infinite depends on
the behavior of <var>proc</var>.
If <var>proc</var> returns, it is the end of the sequence — <var>g</var> returns an

<p>The generators returned by the constructors are exhausted once all elements are retrieved;
the optional <var>start</var>-th and <var>end</var>-th arguments can limit the range
the generator walks across.
</p>

<p>For <code>reverse-vector-&gt;generator</code>, the first value is the element right before
the <var>end</var>-th element, and the last value is the <var>start</var>-th
element.
For all the other constructors, the first value the generator yields
is the <var>start</var>-th element, and it ends right before the <var>end</var>-th element.

<dt><code>make-for-each-generator</code><i> for-each obj</i></dt>
<dd><p>A generator constructor that converts any collection <var>obj</var> to
a generator that returns its elements using a
<var>for-each</var> procedure appropriate for <var>obj</var>.  This must
be a procedure that when called as <var>(for-each proc obj)</var> calls
<var>proc</var> on each element of <var>obj</var>.  Examples of such
procedures are <code>for-each</code>, <code>string-for-each</code>,
and <code>vector-for-each</code> from R7RS.  The value returned by
<var>for-each</var> is ignored.
The generator is finite if the  collection is finite, which would
typically be the case.
</p>
<p>The collections need not be conventional ones (lists, strings, etc.)
as long as <i>for-each</i> can invoke a procedure on everything that
counts as a member.  For example,
the following procedure allows <code>for-each-generator</code> to generate
the digits of an integer from least to most significant:</p>

<dd><p>Works like SRFI 1 <code>fold</code> on the values generated by the generator

</p>
<p>When one generator is given, for each value <var>v</var> generated
by <var>gen</var>,
<var>proc</var> is called as <code>(<var>proc</var> <var>v</var> <var>r</var>)</code>, where
<var>r</var> is the current accumulated result; the initial value of the
accumulated result is <var>seed</var>,
and the return value from <var>proc</var> becomes the next accumulated result.
When <var>gen</var> is exhausted, the accumulated result at that time is returned
from <code>generator-fold</code>.
</p>
<p>When more than one generator is given, <var>proc</var> is
invoked on the values returned by all the generator arguments followed by
the current accumulated result.  
The procedure terminates when any of the <i>gen<sub>n</sub></i>
generators is exhausted, at which time all the others are in an undefined state.

<h2 class="subsection">Accumulator constructors</h2>

<p>These procedures have names ending with <code>accumulator</code>.

<dl>
<dt><code>make-accumulator</code><i> kons knil finalizer</i></dt>
<dd><p>Returns an accumulator that, when invoked on an object
other than an end-of-file object, invokes <i>kons</i> on its
argument and the accumulator's current state, using the same order
as a function passed to <code>fold</code>.  It then sets the accumulator's state
to the value returned by <i>kons</i> and returns an unspecified value.
The initial state of the accumulator is set
to <i>knil</i>.  
However, if an end-of-file object is passed to the accumulator, it returns the
result of tail-calling the procedure <i>finalizer</i> on the state.
Repeated calls with an end-of-file object will reinvoke <i>finalizer</i>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><code>count-accumulator</code></dt>
<dd><p>Returns an accumulator that, when invoked on an object,
adds 1 to a count inside the accumulator
and returns an unspecified value.
However, if an end-of-file object is passed, the accumulator returns the count.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><code>list-accumulator</code></dt>
<dd><p>Returns an accumulator that, when invoked on an object,
adds that object to a list inside the accumulator in order of
accumulation and returns an unspecified value.
However, if an end-of-file object is passed, the accumulator returns the list.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><code>reverse-list-accumulator</code></dt>
<dd><p>Returns an accumulator that, when invoked on an object,
adds that object to a list inside the accumulator in reverse order of
accumulation and returns an unspecified value.
However, if an end-of-file object is passed, the accumulator returns the list.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><code>vector-accumulator</code></dt>
<dd><p>Returns an accumulator that, when invoked on an object,
adds that object to a vector inside the accumulator in order of
accumulation and returns an unspecified value.

</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><code>reverse-vector-accumulator</code></dt>
<dd><p>Returns an accumulator that, when invoked on an object,
adds that object to a vector inside the accumulator in reverse order of
accumulation and returns an unspecified value.
However, if an end-of-file object is passed, the accumulator returns the vector.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><code>vector-accumulator!</code><i> vector at</i></dt>
<dd><p>Returns an accumulator that, when invoked on an object,
adds that object to consecutive positions of <i>vector</i> starting
at <i>at</i> in order of
accumulation.  It is an error to try to accumulate more objects than
<i>vector</i> will hold.  An unspecified value is returned.
However, if an end-of-file object is passed, the accumulator returns <i>vector</i>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><code>string-accumulator</code></dt>
<dd><p>Returns an accumulator that, when invoked on a character,
adds that character to a string inside the accumulator in order of

<dl>
<dt><code>bytevector-accumulator</code></dt>
<dd><p>Returns an accumulator that, when invoked on a byte,
adds that integer to a bytevector inside the accumulator in order of

<dl>
<dt><code>bytevector-accumulator!</code><i> bytevector at</i></dt>
<dd><p>Returns an accumulator that, when invoked on a byte,
adds that byte  to consecutive positions of <i>bytevector</i> starting
at <i>at</i> in order of
accumulation.  It is an error to try to accumulate more bytes than
<i>vector</i> will hold.  An unspecified value is returned.
However, if an end-of-file object is passed, the accumulator returns <i>bytevector</i>.

<dl>
<dt><code>sum-accumulator</code> </dt>
<dd><p>Returns an accumulator that, when invoked on a number,
